  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c005'>THE FOUR BELLES OF BELLEMONT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“God created woman, a living soul, worthy to stand in
His presence and worship him! and if it were only from
the reverence she owes him, she should never degrade
herself to be any man’s slave! God endowed woman
with individual life—with power, will and understanding,
brain, heart and hands to do His work; and if it were
only in gratitude to him, she should never commit the
moral suicide of becoming the nonentity of which man’s
law makes a wife!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a splendid creature who uttered this heterodoxy,
a magnificent and beautiful creature! She spoke
fervently, earnestly, passionately, with blazing eyes,
flushed cheeks and crimsoned lips that seemed to breathe
the fire that burned in her enthusiastic soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was the most brilliant of a group of four lovely
young girls who were seated on the fresh grass, in a
grove of magnolia trees on the south banks of the James.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before them flowed the fair river, fringed with wooded
shores and dotted with green isles, all sparkling in the
early sunlight of a June morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Behind them, from amidst its ornamented grounds,
arose the white walls of Bellemont College for young
ladies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first day of June was the annual commencement
of the college. And these four young girls, all dressed
in purest white robes with rose-colored wreaths and
sashes, had sauntered out together and grouped themselves
under the magnolia trees to wait for the ringing of
the bell which should call them to the exhibition room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Four more beautiful young creatures than these could
scarcely be found in the world. They were called the
Four Belles of Bellemont. They would have been belles
anywhere and borne off palms of beauty from all other
competitors. Yet beautiful as each one was, the four
were not rival belles; because, in fact, each one was of a
totally different style from all the others. They might
be said to represent the four orders of female beauty—the
blue, gray, hazel and black-eyed woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far were they from being rivals, that they were fast
friends, banded in an alliance for offense and defense
against the whole school, if not the whole world!</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte Conyers, the man-hater, the woman’s champion,
the marriage renouncer, first in beauty, grace and
intellect, was, as I said, a magnificent creature—not in
regard to size, for she was not so tall as the blue-eyed
belle, nor so full-fleshed as the hazel-eyed one; but magnificent
in the sense of conscious strength, ardor and
energy with which she impressed all. She felt and made
you feel, that if her earnest soul had been clothed with
the form of a man, she would have been one to govern
the minds of men and guide the fortunes of nations; or,
woman as she was, if law and custom had allowed her
freer action and a fairer field, she would have influenced
the progress of humanity and filled a place in history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte’s present position and prospects were not
very brilliant. She was the orphan ward of a maiden
aunt, who had sent her to this school to be educated as a
governess; and a hard struggle with the world was all
that she had to look forward to; but certainly, if ever a
woman was formed to fight the battle of life without fear
and without reproach, it was this brave, spirited, energetic
young amazon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this quartette of fair girls the second in merit was
certainly Erminie Rosenthal, the daughter of a Lutheran
preacher. Erminie was above the medium height, with a
well-developed, beautifully rounded, buxom form; splendidly
moulded features, blooming complexion, softly
shining, hazel eyes, and a shower of bright, auburn ringlets
shading the sweetest face in the whole group.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third in this bevy of beauties was Elfrida Fielding,
the daughter of a thriving farmer. Elfie was small,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>slight, and elegant in figure, and dark in complexion, with
a rich crimson flush upon cheeks and lips, and with black
eyes, eyelashes and eyebrows, and jet black hair, cut short,
parted on the left side, and worn in crisp curls like a
boy’s. Elfie was the wild sprite, the mischievous monkey,
the fast little girl of the party. She was lively, witty, impulsive,
excitable, fickle, and had an especial affinity for—anything
and everything in its turn, and an especial
mission to engage in—anything and everything that
turned up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourth and last among the four belles of Bellemont,
though certainly first in social position, was Alberta
Goldsborough, the daughter of a wealthy merchant in
Richmond, and the heiress in her own right of a rich
plantation on the James. Alberta was tall, slender and
dignified, with classic, marble-like features, dazzlingly
fair complexion, light golden hair, and light blue eyes.
She was a statuesque blond beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The four belles, languidly reclining under the magnolia
trees, had been discussing as schoolgirls always do
when they get together out of the sight of their teachers—first
the highly important subject of dress; Elfie exclaiming
indignantly at the outrage of being obliged to
wear rose-colored trimmings, when maize or cherry suited
her brilliant brunette beauty so much better; and Alberta
placidly adding that she herself would have preferred
pale blue or mauve as more becoming to her blond complexion.
Erminie made no objection to the uniform,
which was perfectly adapted to her blooming loveliness;
and Britomarte was too indifferent to the subject to join
in the conversation. But when their talk turned upon
matters of secondary importance, namely love and marriage,
and they had talked a great deal of girlish nonsense
thereupon, then Britomarte broke forth with the words
that opened this story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you right, dear Britomarte?” questioned Erminie,
lifting her soft, sunny, hazel eyes to the face of the
speaker, with a loving, deprecating reverence, as though
asking pardon for doubting that any word of her oracle
could be less authoritative than those of Holy Writ.
“Are you quite sure that you are perfectly right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am,” answered Britomarte, firmly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“But is not man’s law of marriage founded upon
God’s?” timidly persisted Erminie, laying her hands upon
the lap of her idol.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! Those who say that it is, repeat a falsehood,
invented by man and inspired by Satan! The law
of marriage founded on the law of God, indeed! There
is not a line or a word in the books of Moses or the gospels
of Christ to justify the base assertion? Pray, were
the glorious women of the Old Testament, Sarah, Rebecca,
Rachel, Esther, Deborah, Judith, Jael—women
who ruled with men—had talked with God and His angels—or
were the divine women of the New Testament,
Mary, Elizabeth, Anna—the mother of the Christ, the
mother of the Baptist, the Prophetess of the Temple—were
any of these, I say, the mere nonentities that man’s
laws makes of married women? Never! And more I
say! Any man who approves of the present laws of
marriage that take away a married woman’s property and
liberty, and even legal existence—any man, I say, who approves
those laws is a despot and despoiler at heart, and
would be a robber and murderer if the fear of prisons
and scaffolds did not hold him in restraint! And any
woman who disapproves these laws, yet dares not express
her disapproval, is a slave and a coward who deserves
her fate!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte, dear, how warm you are. Your cheeks
are quite flushed. Take my fan and try not to get so
excited,” said Alberta, coolly, presenting a pink and
spangled toy to the ardent amazon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold your tongue! Thank you, I don’t want it,”
answered Britomarte, waving away the proffered article.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Britomarte, love,” murmured Erminie, leaning
upon the champion’s lap, and lifting her soft hazel eyes
to the champion’s proud face, with that appealing gaze
with which the loving plead with the fiery, “Britomarte,
darling, ‘Wives, obey your husbands’ are the words of
Holy Writ!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With an impatient gesture Britomarte pushed off her
worshiper, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Paul said that! He was a dry old lawyer, a bookworm
and a bachelor! What did he know about it?
And besides, if he had been like Jacob, a married man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>with two wives, and two handmaids, and twelve children,
I would not take the word of the old apostle any more
than I would that of a modern preacher, unsupported by
the law of Moses and the gospel of Christ! And man’s
legislation upon marriage has been guided neither by law
nor gospel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bosh!” exclaimed Elfie, whom neither pastors nor
masters had been able to break of the use of slang, “let
the poor wretches make all the laws in their own favor,
if it amuses or helps to deceive them. They like it, and
it don’t hurt us! We needn’t trouble our heads to keep
their laws, you know! Let who will bother themselves
about women’s rights, so we have our own way! And
anything we can’t bluster or coax out of our natural
enemy ain’t worth having! Why, law! girls, the creatures
are easily enough managed when you once get used to
them! Why, there are no less than three governors at
Sunnyslopes—one pap and two uncles; but who do you
think, now, rules the <a id='t9'></a>roost at Sunnyslopes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do, when you are at home,” suggested Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You better believe it, my dear! Why, law, girls, I
can wind pap and uncles round my finger as easily as I
can this blade of grass,” said Elfie, suiting the action
to the word with a mischievous sparkle in her bright
black eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, for my part,” said the fair Alberta, coolly playing
with the gold chain upon her bosom, “whenever I
shall be engaged to be married, it will, of course, be to
the proper sort of person. And papa will see that proper
settlements are drawn up between us, and that my own
fortune is settled upon myself to spend as I please. In
that way I shall secure all the rights I care about. I
must have a splendid establishment, with costly furniture,
and carriages, and horses, and servants, and dresses and
jewelry, and unlimited pocket-money. And so that I
have all that, my husband may do all the voting and
make all the laws for both of us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes!” exclaimed Britomarte, bitterly, “it is you and
such as you, Alberta, that retard the progress of woman’s
emancipation! If there were no willing slaves, there
could be no successful tyrants! You are quite willing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>sell your liberty for lucre—to become a slave, so that your
chains and fetters be of gold!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, these ornaments are rather like handcuffs, are
they not?” said Alberta, slightly raising her eyebrows as
she displayed the priceless diamond bracelets on her
wrists. “But I do not see the justice of your words, Britomarte,
since I certainly do not intend to sell my hand
for money, but only to have my own inherited fortune settled
upon myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For which simple price of justice you are willing to
concede your most sacred civil and political rights!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alberta shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know what
you mean,” she said. “I speak to you of pocket-money,
and you answer me with politics. Bah! why should I
care, so that I have a fortune to spend independent of
my future husband? For just think what a trouble it
would be to have to ask him for money every time I
wanted to go shopping!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! a horrid nuisance! I think I shall follow your
example, Alba! I shall get pap to settle the niggers, and
the money, and the old blind mare, and all the rest of the
personal on me by myself, so that my natural enemy,
whenever I shall fall into his hands, can’t take it from
me. In return for which I will promise to keep in my
sphere, and not run for constable nor Congress,” said
Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are both right so far as you go,” said Britomarte,
earnestly, “but you don’t go far enough. A girl
with property is often married only for that property.
And if her husband should be a prodigal and squander
it, and bring her to want, or if he should be a miser and
hoard it, and deprive her of the comforts of life, she has
no redress. Therefore, it is well that a woman’s property
should be settled upon herself, and that she should be
independent of her husband, at least as far as money can
make her so. What do you say, my dear?” she inquired,
turning to Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie hesitated, the bright bloom wavered on her
cheeks, and then deepened into a vivid blush. She
dropped her long-fringed eyelids over her soft eyes, and
answered, gently:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad I am not rich; very glad that I have nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>at all of my own. Now I go to my dear father for
everything I want, and it is sweet to receive it from his
hands; for he never refuses me anything he can afford to
give, and I never ask him for anything he cannot spare.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the Lutheran minister’s daughter paused thoughtfully,
as if in some tender reminiscence of her absent
parent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we are not talking about papas—we are talking
about hubs,” exclaimed Elfie, impatiently. “We are cussing
and discussing the best means of offense and defense
against our natural enemies, meaning our future hubs—poor
wretches!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know,” said Erminie, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, turning her soft eyes, that had strange mesmeric
power in their steady tenderness, upon the face of Britomarte,
she continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, as I am not rich, as I have nothing at all of my
own, no one will ever marry me for anything else but affection.
And, as I find it so sweet to depend on my dear
father, who loves me, I shall find it very sweet also to depend
on another who shall love me—ah! if only half as
well as he does!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you will remain with your father, my darling.
Fathers may be trusted with their daughters—sometimes.
The same cannot be said of lovers or husbands,”
said Britomarte, earnestly, and laying her hand caressing
upon the bright head that leaned against her bosom.
“Yes, I hope you will never commit that spiritual suicide
of which I spoke.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie gently lifted her head from her queen’s bosom—every
motion of the fair girl was gentleness itself—again
she hesitated, and the bloom wavered on her face
and settled into an intense blush, as she softly said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not agree with you, dear Britomarte. I cannot.
Nor do I like discussions on this subject. It seems sacrilegious
to speak so irreverently of the holiest mysteries in
nature, for such, indeed, I deem love and marriage; and
it seems like unveiling the holy of holies in one’s own sacred
bosom to give one’s thoughts and feelings about
them. Still, when that, which to me is a divine truth, is
assailed even by you, dear Britomarte, I must defend it, if
necessary, by laying bare my own heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Defend it, then, my love. Come on! I shall mind
your fencing about as much as I should the pecking of an
excited turtle dove,” said the amazon, with an indulgent
smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet again the bloom wavered and flickered on Erminie’s
sensitive cheek as she murmured, softly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been thinking of all you have said this morning;
I have been listening to my heart, and it has told me
this: To lose self in the one great vital love a true wife
finds in a true husband, is not moral suicide, as you say,
but the passing into another life—a double life—deeper,
sweeter, more intense, and more satisfying than any
known alone. To be content to be guided by his wisdom,
and upheld by his strength, and comforted by his
love—to have no will but his will, which she makes her
own—this is not to be a nonentity, or weak, or silly, or
childish, but to be identical with the husband’s greater life—to
be wise, strong, womanly. She passes into his life,
becomes part and parcel of it. In losing herself she finds
herself; in giving herself away she receives herself again—transfigured!
Oh! Britomarte, I am not intellectual
like you, but I do know, because my heart surely tells me,
that the true wife and the true husband are one—one being
on this earth, as they will be one angel in heaven,”
said the gentle girl, forgetting her timidity in her enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bosh!” cried Elfrida Fielding, in disgust, tearing and
throwing away the withes of grass she had been winding
around her fingers, emblematically of her method of managing
natural enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bah!” yawned Alberta Goldsborough, shrugging her
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you seen many such unions in your short life,
Erminie?” gravely inquired Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I have not; but I know that all unions should be
such! As for myself, I do not think I shall ever love;
but I do know that I shall never marry unless I shall be
sought by one whom I can love with all my heart, and
soul, and spirit; whom I can honor almost as I honor my
Creator; and I can obey in word and deed, with such
perfect assent of my will and understanding, that to obey
his will shall be to have my own way!—one who shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>be to me the life of my life, the arbiter of my fate, almost
my God! Yes, that is what I feel I want, and nothing
else in the universe will satisfy me! That is what every
true woman wants, and nothing else in the universe will
satisfy her! Oh! Britomarte—you who are woman’s
champion—you greatly bewray woman when you ascribe
to the coercion of coarse human laws that divine self-abnegation
and devotion which is the instinct and inspiration
of her own heart!” exclaimed Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The dove pecks sharply—her little beaks are keen,”
said Britomarte, smiling. Then, speaking more gravely,
she added: “Women might be such angels, my darling,
if men were such gods; but you will find few women willing
to be so devoted, and fewer men to deserve such devotion.
Men do not believe in women’s voluntary self-abnegation,
and hence they coerce them by what you call
coarse human laws, by what I call unjust, despotic, egotistical
laws. I return to my point, darling. I hope that
you will never marry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think I ever shall, since it is not likely that I
shall ever meet with any one such as I have described,”
said Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, that you will not, my dear,” said Elfie; “but
you will think you have met such a prodigy, and that will
be all the same to you. You will some day run against
some commonplace John Thompson or Tom Johnson
whom you will take for a Crichton or a Bayard. You
are booked for a grand passion, my dear. It is in your
system and it must come out. It would kill you if it was
to strike in. I pity you, poor child, for that thing don’t
pay. I know all about it; I’ve been all along there!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You, Elfrida?” exclaimed Alberta, with unusual interest,
for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, me, ‘Elfrida!’ You had better believe it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell us all about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to. Well, you see when pap first brought
me to this school to finish my education, we stopped in
the city a few days to fit me out and show me the sights.
One night he took me to see an opera. Hush, girls! I
never was inside of an opera house before in my life; and
you better believe I was dazzled by the splendor and magnificence
around me, and found quite enough to do to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>gape and stare at the gorgeous decorations of the house
and the beautiful dresses of the ladies, until the curtain
rose. Then, whip your horses! The opera was ‘Lucia
di Lammermuir,’ and the part of Edgar Ravenswood
was performed by Signor Adriano di Bercelloni.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the mention of that name Britomarte became attentive.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, whether it was the jaunty bonnet, with the
heron’s feather, or the crimson tartan plaid, or the black
velvet tunic coat, or the white cross-gartered hose and
buskins, or the music, or the man, or all together, I don’t
know; but I fell over head and ears in love with Edgar
Ravenswood. Heavens! how I adored him! Don’t
frown, Britty, And, ah! how I hated Lucia, who had the
divine happiness of being wooed in strains of heavenly
music by Edgar Ravenswood! And, oh! how ardently I
aspired to be a great prima donna, and play Lucia to that
exalted being, Edgar. Alba, if you smile that way I’ll
bite you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did it end?” inquired Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to tell you, Minie. I went home with my
head in a whirl; I had Bercelloni on the brain. Pap
wanted me to come into the dining-room and take some
supper. But faugh! After the divine life of music, buskins,
love, heron’s feather, romance and Ravenswood, the
mere idea of eating was revolting to the last degree!
But I made pap promise to take me to the opera the next
night. ‘Why, daught., you are music mad,’ he said. ‘I
am very fond of music, pap,’ I answered. Law girls! he
believed it was only the music! Our paps are very simple-minded
people. Or else they have learned so much
wisdom in their age that they have forgotten all they
knew in their youth. Don’t you think so, Alba?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but never mind about the old gentleman. Tell
us of the signior.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, instead of feasting on a vulgar supper, I went
to bed to feast on memories of the divine life of the opera
and on hopes of living it over again on the next evening.
Ah! how I worshiped the Signior Bercelloni! Ah! how
I detested the Signiora Colona! Ah! how I aspired to be
a famous prima donna! I felt capable of dying for Bercelloni,
of choking Colona, and of running away from pap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>to become a prima donna. I was in the last stage of illusion,
hallucination, mania! Don’t glower at me so,
Britty! or I can’t go on. Ah! if our paps did but know, it
is not always safe to take every one of us to such places!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, it is not!” exclaimed Britomarte, so earnestly,
so bitterly, so regretfully, with so dark a shadow overhanging
her face, that little Elfie paused and gazed at her
in dismay, faltering:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Britty, what is the matter? Surely, you
never——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” said Britomarte, recovering herself with an
effort, “I was never at an opera. Go on. How did it
end?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did it end? As a Fourth of July rocket ends, of
course. It streamed up from the earth a blazing meteor,
aspiring to the heavens! It fell down to the ground a
blackened stick, to be trodden under foot!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah!” sighed Erminie, in a voice full of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfie laughed, and went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“But to leave the hifaluting and come down to the common.
It was very late when I got up next morning, and
pap was as late as I was. And when we sat down to the
breakfast table we found a party sitting opposite to us
who were as late as we were. I didn’t look at them. I
was still in a dream, living in memories of the past evening
and hopes of the coming one. In so deep a dream,
that I didn’t know whether I was breakfasting off an
omelette or stewed kid gloves, until pap stooped and whispered
to me: ‘Daught., there’s Signior Adriano di Bercelloni
sitting opposite to us.’ I woke from my dream
and raised my eyes to see. Was it Bercelloni? I looked
and looked again before I could be sure. Yes, it was he!
But oh! my countrymen, what a change was there! How
like, yet how unlike my gorgeous hero of the evening
before! His head was bald! his face was bloated! his
form was round! Ugh! His eyes were red! his nose
was blue; his teeth were yellow—ugh! ugh! He had a
great plate of macaroni and garlic before him, and a
great spoon in his hand, with which he shoveled the mess
down his throat, as a collier shovels coal into a cellar—faugh!
Whatever he had done to himself to make him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>look so differently on the stage, I don’t know. But the
sight of him <em>au natural</em> made me sick and cured me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so that is the end of the story?” inquired Alberta.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not quite. On one side of him sat a swarthy,
scrawny signiora, who was the wife of his ‘buzzum’. And
on the other sat an equally swarthy and scrawny signorina,
who was the lovely pledge of their wedded affections.
And that’s not all either, Alba. That evening pap said,
‘Well, daught., shall we go to the opera to see the Signior
Bercelloni play Fra Diavolo?’ I answered, ‘Thank you,
pap, I had rather not.’ And so we went to church instead
to hear the celebrated Rev. Mr.—What’s-his-name?
Law! you know who I mean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you fall in love with him?” inquired Alberta.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not as I know of! He may have had ‘a very beautiful
spirit,’ as some of his admirers say; but, if so, it was
clothed with a very unattractive person. Next day pap
brought me here to school, and I have been here ever
since, except when I have gone home for the holidays.
Now, sisteren, I have given in my experience at this love
feast for the benefit of Sister Erminie Rosenthal; and I
hope she will profit by it. And now, I think, that is all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alberta and Erminie laughed, but Britomarte looked
very grave as she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Elfrida, that is not all. I have a sequel to your
story, but I will not tell it to you now. I will tell you
this, however: The old glutton who revolted your taste
at the breakfast was Signior Adriano di Bercelloni, the
elder, and the father of Signior Adriano di Bercelloni,
the younger, whom you saw play Edgar Ravenswood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Britomarte spoke, Elfie gazed at her with open eyes
and mouth in silent amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have the same name, and they bear a strong personal
resemblance to each other, modified by the difference
of age and temperament; but they never play the
same parts. How could you imagine, my dear, that there
could be any arts of the toilet, or effect of the stage, that
could transfigure that coarse old creature into the hero of
an opera?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. I thought toilet arts, and stage effects,
were almost miraculous. But what astounds me is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>cunning of the gay old deceiver, my pap! Now, I wonder
if he didn’t see my infatuation from the beginning! I
wonder if he didn’t show me the old one, and let me deceive
myself, on purpose?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, he did,” opined Alberta.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how came you to know anything about them—so
much about them, I may say, Britty, dear?” Elfie inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I said I had a sequel to your story; but I cannot tell
it now,” replied Britomarte, very gravely. Then, after a
thoughtful pause, she added: “I think it wrong—oh!
very wrong—in parents and guardians to take young, inexperienced,
impressible girls to such places. If they
love music, let them have as many concerts as they please,
but no operas, and no plays—except, perhaps, a few
of Shakespeare’s best historical plays.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How old are you, Britomarte?” suddenly inquired Alberta.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte paused as though she could scarcely answer
that question at a moment’s warning; and then she answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am eighteen. Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You talk as if you were eighty—that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have had enough to age me,” said Britomarte, putting
Erminie’s caressing arms from her neck, and rising,
and walking away, as if to conceal, or overcome, some
strong and deep emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte speaks bitterly,” said Elfie, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has good reason to do so,” replied Alba, meaningly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What reason?” inquired Elfie and Erminie, in a
breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Law! don’t you know? Have you never heard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I don’t know whether I ought to tell it. It
seems unfair to do so. It seems, indeed, like speaking
ill of her family behind her back. She might not like
it,” said Alberta, hesitating.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, don’t do it,” urged Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do!” insisted Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you see, I never knew a word of it myself until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>last Easter holidays, when I was home on a visit, and
heard it by the merest accident. For you know she
never mentions a word about her family.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, never; except sometimes to allude to the maiden
aunt who pays her school bills. But do tell me! Is it
anything bad?” eagerly inquired Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, very,” replied Alberta, with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to think you should have known the secret ever
since last Easter and kept it from us!” exclaimed Elfie,
with a reproachful look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see I kept it to myself for her sake,” explained
Alberta, with an apologetic smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep it so still, Alberta,” earnestly urged Erminie.
“If you have become possessed of any secret that you
think Britomarte would not like to have divulged, it
would be disloyalty to your friend to divulge it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bosh! It is all among friends, so what’s the harm?
Go on, Alberta. I am on thorns until I hear all about
it. Was it a murder, or a forgery, or a bigamy, or an
elopement, or an—or what was it?” eagerly questioned
Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was neither of these. It was something far more—Where
are you going, Erminie?” Alberta suddenly broke
off in the middle of her sentence to ask of her fair companion,
who had risen and was walking away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going out of hearing of a secret that my friend
might not like me to know,” answered the true-hearted
girl, leaving Alberta to tell Britomarte’s mystery to her
only willing listener.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c005'>THE MAN-HATER’S LOVER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Erminie sauntered slowly down the winding footpath
leading through the magnolia grove to the acacia avenue,
on the banks of the river. She had not gone far when,
a few paces in advance of her she saw Britomarte walking
alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not wishing to intrude on the amazon in her dark
hour, Erminie was turning away, when Britomarte by
some means became aware of her presence, and looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>back with an expression of ineffable tenderness, and beckoned
her to approach.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gentle girl went to the brilliant amazon’s side, and
was encircled by her arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks for letting me come, dear Britomarte,” she
murmured, lifting her soft, hazel eyes to meet the gaze
of the splendid dark-gray orbs that were shining down
upon her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My bonny love, I never wish to avoid you. In my
darkest hour you are ever welcome to me,” answered
the man-hater, in the soft tone and with the sweet smile
she ever used in addressing this best-beloved of her
soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you! Thank you, dearest Britomarte!” Erminie
exclaimed, kissing the hand of her friend. But,
then growing grave, she added, “Oh, my dearest love,
I am so sorry you are such an intense man-hater! Your
wholesale hatred makes you so unjust! It is the one
dark spot on the bright disc of your clear, warm, strong,
sunlike nature! All men are not brutes, dearest Britomarte.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then they are imbeciles! There is but one division.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! Do you mean that all men are either brutes or
idiots?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Britomarte, how can you—can you—say so,
dearest? You had a father!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dark as a thundercloud grew the beautiful face of the
amazon; harsh, curt and strange were the words of her
reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I had a father with little claim upon my love,
and less upon my honor. Never name him to me again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie was appalled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte stopped in her walk and sat down at the
foot of a tree, as if overshadowed by some dark destiny.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie sank down at her feet and laid her head on her
lap.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both were silent for a time, and the only sounds that
broke the stillness were the whispering of the leaves above
their heads, the hum of the insects around them, and
the ripple of the river below.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Erminie began to sob softly, while Britomarte laid her
hand gently on her pet’s head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte, dearest, I am sorry that I hurt you; I
would not have done it for a kingdom, if I had known
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure you would not, darling!—sure you would
not! Say no more about it, love; but tell me of your
own father, who cannot come under my severe category
because I do not know him; and tell me of that wonderful
brother whom you idolize so much, and whom I have
never seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father and my brother,” murmured the minister’s
daughter, as at the memory of cherished home affections—“my
dear father and dear brother! Ah! Britomarte,
if you had known them you would never have been a
man-hater! When you do know them you will cease to
be one!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then a miracle will be performed,” said the beauty.
“But tell me, are they coming to the commencement?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not sure. That is to say, I know that one of
them will come to fetch me home, for my father wrote to
say so; but I am not sure which. Perhaps both may
come. I hope they may. I want my dear father to be
present to-day. A triumph is no triumph to me unless
he witnesses it; and oh! I am so impatient to see my dear
brother. I have not seen him, you know, since he left us,
five years ago, for Gottengen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your brother is studying for holy orders, I think you
told me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes. He has a genuine call to the ministry of the
gospel if ever any man had one in this world. He has
sacrificed the most brilliant prospects of earthly success
to obey that call.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is that, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, why you know he is my father’s only son, and
except myself, his only child, for there are but two of us,
my brother and myself. Justin is ten years older than I
am, however, since I was but sixteen in May, and he
will be twenty-six in August.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but about the sacrifice he made, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am telling you. My dear brother and myself are
the only children of the house of Rosenthal. My father’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>family is not what is called a marrying family.
Father has two bachelor brothers, who are the great
woolen importers. Uncle Friedrich has the Berlin house
and Uncle Wilhelm the New York house. They offered
to take Justin into the business, and bring him up as their
successor, but he felt this call to preach the gospel, and
he declined their offer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a great sacrifice,” said Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was; but our dear father encouraged him to make
it. Oh, there are very few like our father; and Justin is
worthy to be his son! He has come home to stay now!
And he is to be ordained this coming autumn! Oh, Britomarte,
you must come and visit them, and go with me
to see his ordination.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be pleased to do so, my dear! Listen! Yes,
the bell is ringing! We must go and take our places on
the platform. I suppose many of the friends of the
pupils have arrived. What a pity it is they cannot see
their charges until after the ceremonies,” said Britomarte,
rising to retrace her steps towards the college
buildings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; it is a pity; but I suppose their earlier meeting
is prohibited to prevent confusion and delay. I saw
Alba’s parents roll by in their open barouche as I came
down here. And there are Elfie’s father and two uncles
riding up on horseback. And my dear father and
brother, or both, will be here presently. But, Britomarte,
who is coming for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No one. No one ever does come, nor do I wish that
any should. I am contented, darling.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are self-reliant! But, dear Britomarte, I will be
near you, so do remember that one will watch your ordeal
with as much interest as father, mother, sister and
brother, all combined, could do; and will mourn over
your defeat, or rejoice over your victory, more than
over her own.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do believe it, my darling! And therefore I take
pleasure in assuring you that you shall have cause only
for rejoicing. I shall achieve a victory, Erminie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! I never doubted that! I was always sure of
that. What is your theme, dear Britomarte? You will
not object to tell me, now that the reading is so near.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“My dearest, I should not have objected to tell you at
any period, if you had asked me to do so. My theme is
the ‘Civil and Political Rights of Woman.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a tremendous subject! Britomarte, dear, you
will be sent to Coventry by all the professors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps! But do you think I shall go there?”
laughed the beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time they were approaching the college through
the roseries, as the terraces, adorned principally with
these beautiful flowers, were called. On the upper terrace
they made a turn to the left, to avoid the carriages
that were continually rolling up to the front entrance,
depositing their freights and rolling off again.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two friends entered a side door, and found themselves
in a large ante-room, in which were assembled all
their schoolmates in the festive school uniform of pure
white muslin dresses, pink ribbons and rose wreaths.</p>

<p class='c007'>And among them walked Alba Goldsborough, the
blond beauty and wealthy heiress, and Elfrida Fielding,
the bright little brunette country girl. These two girls
walked apart, with their arms around each other’s
waists, conversing in confidential whispers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are still talking of Britomarte!” said Erminie,
indignantly, to herself, and as she looked at them her suspicion
was confirmed; for as soon as they saw her with
Britomarte they ceased to talk, and began to look embarrassed.
But before the quartet of friends could meet,
the great folding doors, separating the ante-room from
the exhibition hall, were thrown open, and two of the
teachers appeared to marshal the pupils to the scene of
their approaching ordeal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Promptly and quietly they fell into line and marched
into the hall—a spacious room of the Corinthian order of
architecture, fitted up as a temple of the muses—the nine
muses being represented by nine statues supporting the
arches separating the platform from the part of the hall
occupied by the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>This platform was provided with rows of benches covered
with crimson cloth, for the accommodation of the
pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up the side stairs leading to this platform the line of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>pupils marched. They seated themselves on the benches
in good order, and then surveyed the scene before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hall was crowded with a large number of spectators,
among which were to be seen distinguished learned
professors, noted preachers and the heads of neighboring
colleges. But the great mass of the audience consisted
of the parents and guardians, friends and relatives of
pupils and teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alberta Goldsborough, the wealthy heiress, recognized
her stately papa and fashionable mamma, and saluted
them with a cold, young-ladyish bow as she sank into
her seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfrida descried, seated away back in an obscure corner,
the three honest country gentlemen whom she saucily
designated “one pap and two unks.” And she audaciously
kissed her hand to them with a loud smack as
she popped into her place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie discerned, near the middle of the crowd, her
revered father and idolized brother, and exchanged with
them a bow and smile of recognition and joy. But, oh,
fate of Tantalus! though she had not seen her father for
ten months, nor her brother for five years, she could not
either approach or speak to them; she could not even turn
to Britomarte and point them out; she could only bow
and smile, for silence and decorum were rigidly enforced
upon the pupils on the commencement day at Bellemont
College.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte, with her sad eyes wandering over the assemblage,
saw not one familiar face. But Britomarte
was almost alone in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ceremonies of the day began.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, as there is nothing in this wearisome world half
so wearisome to an uninterested spectator as a school exhibition
or a college commencement, and as this anniversary
at Bellemont partook of both characters, I will
spare my readers the details of the proceedings and discuss
the whole affair with as few words as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professors preached and pupils prosed on the platform;
while the spectators fanned themselves vigorously, or
yawned behind fans of every description, from the plain
palmleaf to the scented sandalwood, in the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Teachers and scholars were alike in the highest state of
exultation and—the deepest degree of fatigue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The audience politely pronounced the affair to be very
interesting and—heartily wished it over.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fact the exercises of the day were only redeemed
from the most ordinary monotony by the reading of Britomarte
Conyers’ theme—“The Civil and Political Rights
of Women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At Bellemont College the themes were not read by the
writers, because in that immaculate institution it was
deemed unladylike for a young lady to stand upon a
platform before a mixed audience and read her own composition
aloud, and it was also thought that the embarrassment
which a young writer would be likely to feel in
such a position would seriously mar the delivery and detract
from the effect of her theme. So it was arranged
that all the themes should be read aloud by the professor
of elocution to the institution, whose highly cultivated
style would certainly improve the poorest composition,
and do full justice to the richest. He “lent to the words
of the poet the music of his voice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He read with great effect Britomarte Conyers’ essay
on the “Civil and Political Rights of Women,” in which
the author bravely asserted not only the rights of married
women to the control of their own property and custody
of their own children, but the rights of all women to a
competition with men in all the paths of industry and a
share with them in all the chances of success—in the mechanical
arts, in learned professions, in commercial business,
in municipal and national government, in the camp,
the field, the ship; in the Senate, in the Cabinet, on the
Bench, and in the Presidential chair. She supported her
argument with the names and examples of the noteworthy
women of all ages and countries—women, who, in despite
of the obstacles of law, precedent and prejudice,
had distinguished themselves in every field of enterprise
ever illustrated by men. It was altogether a clear, warm,
strong, brilliant article; and, like all works of genius, it
received an almost equal share of enthusiastic praise and
extravagant blame. It was excessively admired for the
strength, beauty and ingenuity of its argument, and bitterly
censured for the heterodoxy of its doctrines.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Among those who listened to the reading was Justin
Rosenthal, the brother of Erminie, who, seated beside
his father, gave the most earnest attention to the argument.</p>

<p class='c007'>At its conclusion, he turned to the elder Rosenthal, and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is the most original, outspoken and morally courageous
assertion of right against might that has been
made since the immortal Declaration of Independence!
And that it should have been written by a schoolgirl
seems almost incredible. A rare, fine spirit—a pure, noble
heart—a clear, strong intellect she has. I wonder
who she is?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know,” replied Dr. Rosenthal, for Erminie’s
father was a D. D.—“I do not know; but I do
know that her argument, though ingenious, is wrong
from beginning to end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Later on was announced the name of the successful
candidate for the medal to be awarded for the best
English theme. The medal was awarded to Britomarte
Conyers, for her essay on the “Civil and Political Rights
of Woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte Conyers, then, is the author of that theme
you admire so much, and is the young lady you are so
curious to see. I congratulate you, Justin! Miss Conyers
is your sister’s most intimate friend. You will have
an opportunity not only of seeing her, but of forming her
acquaintance under the most auspicious circumstances,”
said Dr. Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay,” smiled Justin, “I do not know that I care to
follow up any such acquaintance with the young champion
of womankind. I merely wish to see and judge her
as a rather singular specimen of her sex.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was at the school ball of the evening that Justin
Rosenthal was presented to Britomarte Conyers, whose
personal beauty and grace made as deep an impression
on his heart as her genius had made upon his mind. At
the same time and place Colonel Eastworth, a distinguished
son of South Carolina, was introduced to Erminie.
And thus two of our young friends met the persons
who were destined to exercise the most powerful
influence over their future lives.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>The next morning the school broke up for the midsummer
holidays, and the pupils went their several ways.
Elfrida Fielding went with her father and uncles to Sunnyslopes.
Alberta Goldsborough accompanied her parents
to the Rainbows, their waterside villa. And the Rosenthals,
with Colonel Eastworth and Britomarte Conyers,
embarked on the steamer bound for Washington.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c005'>A MYSTERIOUS LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The barouche containing Dr. Rosenthal and his party
reached the steamer in such good season that the two
young ladies had time to go down into the cabin and
choose their berths from among those left vacant, and to
make all arrangements for their comfort during the voyage.
They took two berths in a stateroom together, unpacked
their traveling bags, laid their toilet articles in
order upon the little shelf below the tiny looking-glass,
and then returned to the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>They sat down on the side that still looked toward
Bellemont College, whose white walls arose from amidst
green foliage on the crest of a gentle hill at a short distance
up the river. Half in joy at work accomplished
and freedom gained, half in regret at leaving the school
where they had been so happy for so many years, and
teachers whom they had loved so well, the young friends
gazed upon their late home.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gentlemen of their party meanwhile walked up and
down the deck, wondering when the steamer would start,
and betraying all the impatience and restlessness of their
restless and impatient sex, until, as they passed near the
two young ladies, Justin Rosenthal left his companions,
and, with a bow and a smile, as if asking permission, or
apologizing for taking it for granted, seated himself beside
Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte would have given a year of her life to have
repressed the blush that mantled over her cheek and brow
as Justin took the seat beside her.</p>

<p class='c007'>His first words were well chosen to set her at ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The scenery of James River is quite new to me, Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Conyers. We came down from Washington by railroad
to Richmond, and thence by stagecoach to Bellemont. I
look upon this fine river for the first time,” he said, not,
as before, fixing his eyes upon her, but letting them rove
over the bright waters of the James and the verdant hills
beyond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte only bowed in reply. She would have given
another year of her life for the power of controlling the
unusual tremor that seized her frame and made it dangerous
to trust her voice for a steady answer in words.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, still letting his eyes rove over the river, and rest
here and there upon particular points of interest in the
scenery, spoke of the beautiful effects of the shining light
and shade as the clouds floated over the sun’s disk and
their shadows passed over the hills.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Britomarte merely answered “yes” or “no,” until,
indignant at the influence that was growing upon her, she
suddenly erected her haughtly little head with an impatient
shake, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>That she could not appreciate the minutiae of river
scenery; that only the ocean in its grandeur and might
could awaken her admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment Dr. Rosenthal called to his son, and
Justin, with a bow, left the side of Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Britty, dearest! I always thought you loved
river scenery,” said Erminie, when they were left alone
together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I do, as a general thing, but I don’t care about it
to-day,” answered Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Britty, dear, I never knew you to be capricious
before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nature has given me no immunity from the common
weaknesses of humankind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie looked so hurt at the curtness of her friend’s
words and manner, that Britomarte suddenly took her
hand and tenderly caressed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie, touched by this new proof of love, was encouraged
to press Britomarte to go home with her to the
parsonage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers caressed her and thanked her, but reiterated
her resolution to go to Witch Elms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! don’t, ah! don’t—don’t go to that horrid place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>dear Britomarte! You don’t know what it is! They
say—that the place is haunted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, they say every isolated old country house is
haunted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—forgive me once again, dear Britomarte—are
you expected or desired there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know. My old aunt has never written to me.
The half-yearly payments for the schooling, for which I
am indebted to her, always have been forwarded by her
agent in Washington. On each occasion I have written
to her a letter of thanks, but I have never received an
answer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then a boy rushed up with a letter for Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>She opened it wonderingly, and turned to the signature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face was suddenly blanched to the hue of death,
and she reeled, as though about to fall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte, dear Britomarte, what is it? Any bad
news?” anxiously exclaimed Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Miss Conyers raised her hand with a silencing
gesture, and arose to go down below. She trembled so
much as she moved, that Erminie started forward to attend
her. But with a repelling motion the pallid girl
stopped her friend, and hurried alone on her way.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the morning the <em>Thetis</em> steamed down the river.
At the dinner hour Erminie was very glad of the excuse
to go down into the stateroom she occupied in common
with Britomarte, to take off her bonnet and mantle, and
brush her hair, to go to the public table.</p>

<p class='c007'>She opened the door timidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers was lying on the upper berth, with the
curtains drawn down before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte, dear Britomarte, how are you? Can I do
anything for you?” murmured Erminie, stealing to the
berth and cautiously lifting a corner of the curtain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! don’t speak to me! leave me!” was all that Miss
Conyers replied, and in a voice so hoarse as to be nearly
inaudible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pale with pity and with awe, Erminie dropped the curtain,
and sank into the one chair their little den boasted.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat there quite still, and forgetting to prepare for
dinner until the bell clanged out its invitation to the table
and aroused her from her trance of trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Then she hastily arose, threw off her bonnet, shook back
her auburn ringlets, and hurried out to join her father
and his friends, who were on their way to the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much concern was expressed by them that Miss Conyers
was not able to come to dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once again in the course of that afternoon Erminie
went to the stateroom to implore Britomarte to take
some refreshment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Miss Conyers suddenly drew the curtain back,
and turned upon the intruder a face so pale and ghastly
in its grief and horror that Erminie shrank back appalled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you see that it takes the whole power of my will
to hold body and soul together until I get to New York?”
she demanded, in a voice husky with suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To New York!” repeated the panic-stricken girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—I can do no more. I cannot eat, or drink, or
talk—much. I can only manage to live until I get there.
Leave me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Heaven of heavens, what has happened to you,
Britomarte!” exclaimed Erminie, as she turned, unwillingly,
to leave the stateroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers did not divulge what had upset her, but
pleaded headaches for absenting herself from the table.
Erminie was unable to comfort her, nor was she taken
into the confidence of the sullen and solitary mourner.</p>

<p class='c007'>In due time the <em>Thetis</em> landed at her pier at Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the great bustle of arrival ensued.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear Miss Conyers,” said Dr. Rosenthal, “I understand
from my daughter that you have positively declined
making us a visit; but now, at the last moment, let me
prevail with you to make us all happy by consenting to go
home with us at least for a day and night, if no longer, to
rest before you go farther.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you very much—more than I can express.
But it is not in my power to accept your kind invitation.
Urgent business compels me immediately to go to New
York. I know that a train leaves in an hour from this.
And I must drive to the station instantly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers embraced Erminie, who was bathed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>tears, and then turned to shake hands with Mr. Justin
Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, raising his hat with a grave bow, Justin said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will see you to the station. Eastworth and my father
are a sufficient bodyguard to Erminie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And before the beautiful man-hater could object, he
had taken her hand and was leading her from the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>He placed her in a carriage, entered and took a seat by
her side, and gave the order to drive to the Baltimore
railway station.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this was done in spite of Britomarte’s tacit protest.
He did not, however, obtrude his conversation upon her.
The drive was finished in silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>On their arrival at the station, he procured her ticket,
checked her baggage, and then placed her in one of the
most comfortable seats in the ladies’ car.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even then he did not leave her, but remained stationed
by her until the shrill, unearthly whistle of the engine
warned him to leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, bending over her, he took her hand and whispered
low:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Conyers, I never utter vain or hasty words.
What I speak now, I speak earnestly from the depths of
my heart. In me you have a friend through good report
and evil report, through life and death, through time and
eternity. I have never spoken these words to any human
being before this; I never shall speak them to any other
after this. Good-by; we shall meet again in a happier
hour.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c005'>THE WITCH OF WITCH ELMS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After seeing Britomarte well on her way, Justin walked
thoughtfully home to the parsonage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Days passed; but no news came of Miss Conyers.
Eastworth remained at the parsonage, wooing the minister’s
daughter—never with compromising words, but
with glances more eloquent and tones more expressive
than words could ever be. For if his words were only,
“The day is beautiful,” his tone said, “I love you!” his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>glance said, “For you are more beautiful than the summer’s
day.” And Erminie! how entirely she believed in
him; how devotedly she loved him; how disinterestedly
she worshiped him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I could in any way add to his fame, or honor, or
happiness, how blessed I should be! And oh! if he
should go away without ever telling me what I could do
to please him, how wretched I should become! Ah! he
may meet more beautiful, more accomplished and more
distinguished women in the great world than ever I can
hope to be; but he will never meet with one who could
love him more than I do!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such reveries as these, scarcely taking the form of
words, even in her thoughts, engaged the young girl constantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of this trouble came letters from the Goldsboroughs.
One from Papa Goldsborough to Papa Rosenthal,
inviting him, his family and his guest to come down
to the Rainbows on a visit for the season; and another
from Alberta to Erminie, urging her to use her influence
with her father to induce him to accept the invitation
and be at the Rainbows to spend the approaching Fourth
of July.</p>

<p class='c007'>No interference on the part of Erminie was needed.
Dr. Rosenthal, with the concurrence of his son and his
guest, wrote to Mrs. Goldsborough to say that he and his
party would be at the Rainbows on the evening of the
third proximo. And as this letter was dated on the
thirtieth of June, there were but two days left to prepare
for the journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as this letter was written and posted and fairly
on its way, Erminie went to look for her brother in the
library, where, in study, he passed his mornings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin, do I interrupt you?” she inquired, in a deprecating
tone, as she opened the door and found him at his
books.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my dear, you never do,” replied Justin, closing
the volume in his hand and drawing forward a chair for
his sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin, I want you to do something for me this afternoon,
please,” she said, as she seated herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“Oh, Justin, it is now four weeks since Britty went
away, and we have heard nothing from her, and we do
not know where to address her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to-morrow evening we start for the Rainbows, to
be absent from the city for the whole remainder of the
season.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Justin, I cannot, indeed I cannot bear to go away
without first trying to find out something about my dear
Britomarte.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so I wish you, if you please, to get a carriage and
take me across Benning’s Bridge to Witch Elms, to ask
about her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin could refuse his sister nothing, so the carriage
was ordered and Witch Elms was reached after a tedious
drive through a heavy rainstorm. The entrance was
stoutly barred, but the travelers were at last admitted and
shown into a wide parlor, the door being instantly shut
and locked upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, amazed by this proceeding, began to search
around for another exit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The person who had admitted them had left them in
total darkness, so it was no easy matter making one’s way
about. At last Justin came to a flight of stairs leading
upward, and bidding his sister take his arm, they ascended.</p>

<p class='c007'>On reaching the upper hall, Justin whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen; do you hear anything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an unmistakable murmur proceeding from
some dark room in their vicinity, and then an angry
voice spoke aloud:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why the foul fiend, then, didn’t you take them in to
see the old woman?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The muttering voice made some reply, to which the
loud voice responded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bosh! What danger? That’s all over now. The
verdict of the coroner’s inquest settled that. Suicide.
Nothing more likely. After that there was nothing more
to be said.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A blaze of lightning that flashed through every chink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and crevice of the shut-up old house, and a crash of
thunder that overwhelmed all other sounds, stopped the
talk of the unseen companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the muttering voice was heard again, saying
something offensive to the interlocutor, though inaudible
to the listeners, for the loud voice replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drinking; no, I have not been drinking! At least
not more than is good for me! The moment any one
takes a deep breath and shows a little fearlessness, you
think they’ve been—drinking! Go and look after the
people you have left in the hall so long, and take them
up to see the old woman. That is, if she wants to see
them. You must humor her; but as for the girl——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the murmuring voice intervened, but the loud
voice broke in:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you she must be got out of the way! Now go
look after these visitors below.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A sound of shuffling feet was heard, and Justin whispered
to Erminie:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little sister, there’s something wrong here, but we
must not seem to have been listening.” And, so saying,
he hurried her down the stairs, as fast as the darkness
would permit him to do with safety. Arrived at the foot,
he waited some few minutes, and then he sang out as
loud as he could:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hallo! waiter! porter! footman! major-domo! man of all work!
whatever or whoever you are! where are
you? Come, let us in; or let us out!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am here, set fire to you! Couldn’t you be quiet for
five minutes, while I was gone to tell the old lady?”
answered a growling voice from the hall above. And at
the same time a person, bearing a dim light, began to
descend the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a man of about thirty years of age, of gigantic
height; but with a small head, and closely-cut black hair,
and a beardless, or else closely-shaven, dark-complexioned
face; a man you would not like to meet on a lonely
road on a dark night. He was dressed from head to foot
in a closely-fitting suit of the dust-colored coarse cloth
that has since become so well known as the uniform of
the Confederate army.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Couldn’t you be easy for five minutes, while I was
gone?” he growled, as he reached the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your minutes are very long ones, friend!” laughed
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You want to see the old lady, you say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish to see Miss Pole.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come along, then,” said the man, stopping to snuff
the candle with his fingers, and then leading the way upstairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, still holding his sister closely under his arm,
reascended the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the light of the candle carried by the man before
him, he saw that this part of the old house seemed entirely
unfurnished. The floors were bare and rough, and
broken here and there, and the walls were disfigured by
torn paper and fallen plastering.</p>

<p class='c007'>This hall of the third story was neatly papered and
comfortably carpeted, and well lighted by a small, clear
lamp hanging from the ceiling. A large window at the
end of this hall was also curtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The smooth-chinned giant in the dust-colored clothes
opened the nearest door to the right, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go in there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With Erminie tucked under one arm, and his hat in his
hand, Justin entered the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a neatly-furnished sitting-room, lighted, like
the hall, by a small, clear lamp, hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under this lamp stood a large, round center-table, covered
with flowered green cloth, and laden with books,
bookmarks, hand-screens, smelling-bottles, a small open
workbox, and, in short, all the paraphernalia of a lady’s
table.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beside it, in a large resting-chair, with her feet upon a
foot-cushion, reclined a very old lady, bent with age, and
trembling with palsy. She was wrapped in a light-colored
French chintz dressing-gown, and her shaking head
was covered with a fine lace cap, whose deep borders
softly shaded her silver hair and withered face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve come to see me?” inquired the old lady, in a
shrill and quivering voice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Yes, madam; I hope to see you in your usual health,”
said the young man, bending his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To business, sir,” snapped the old lady. “I suppose
you come from Trent, my agent?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, madam; I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, what did you come for? I receive no visitors
except upon business,” interrupted the old lady, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pardon us, madam. We are friends of your niece;
and not having heard from her for some weeks, and being
on the point of leaving the city for the season, we
came here to inquire about her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“About—whom?” demanded Miss Pole, in a shrill, impatient
voice, as she began to tremble with excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your niece, Miss Conyers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Shaking violently, the old lady moved her hand to the
bell and rang it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weird handmaid appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nan, Nan, show these people downstairs, and tell
Dole to see ’em out! and to mind how he sends unwelcome
visitors to me again!” exclaimed the old lady,
shaking more and more violently with growing excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope I have given you no cause for offense, madam,”
said Justin, deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Offense! off—offense!” stammered the old lady, with
her head nodding fast between palsy and anger. “How
dare you mention the name of Britomarte Conyers in my
presence?—a toad! a beast! a snake!” And at every epithet
she spat with spite. “Show ’em out! show ’em out!
show ’em out, Nan!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very sorry, madam, to hear you speak in this intemperate
manner of your niece. I have the highest respect
for Miss Conyers,” said Justin, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go! go! go!” sputtered the old creature, letting fall
her cane, and seizing a book, which, with all her trembling
strength, she launched at the offender. But, of
course, the missile fell wide of its mark.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie, shocked, amazed and terrified, clung to the
arm of her brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you a better spirit, Miss Pole,” said Justin;
and, bowing as courteously as if he were leaving the presence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of a queen, who had conferred upon him a grace,
he passed out of the room with his sister.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c005'>THE RAINBOWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Next day the party sailed down the Chesapeake to the
Goldsworths’ seaside home, a beautiful spot on the eastern
shore called the “Rainbows.” Here they were received
by Albert Goldsworth, who bade them a hearty welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie was surprised and delighted to learn that Elfrida
Fielding and Britomarte Conyers had promised to
join the party by the end of the week.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meeting between Britomarte and Erminie was a
very affecting one. Miss Conyers was clothed in deep
mourning, but gave no reply to the inquiries made by
the others respecting her black dress.</p>

<p class='c007'>When pressed by Erminie she simply said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Darling, I have lost some one; I have suffered; but
my heart is not broken, else I should not be here. That
is all that I can tell you, for there is good reason why I
cannot tell you more. I hate mystery, my pet; but this
mystery—and I acknowledge that it is one—is none of
mine. Ask me no more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers was certainly the most brilliant woman
in the circle of beauties gathered together at the Rainbows.
Nothing but her poverty, obscurity, and the mystery
underlying her life, prevented her from being the
belle of the seaside villa. But poor, obscure and even
questionable as was her social position, she excited the
admiration of the men, the jealousy of the women, and
the interest of all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin Rosenthal loved Britomarte Conyers with a
depth and earnestness of affection and a singleness and
persistence of purpose very rarely experienced in this
world of many distracting attractions and conflicting interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>To win her as his wife was just now the first object of
his existence, an object which he determined to accomplish
before he should undertake any other enterprise—
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>so as to get the affair off his mind, he said, and also that
they two might commence the work of the world together
as man and woman should.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Britomarte? Well, it would have been almost
impossible for any other woman, and it was difficult even
for her, to conceal from the deeply-interested, keenly-searching
eyes of her lover the true state of her affections.
Britomarte loved Justin; but she combated that
love with all the strength of her strong will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The summer was fading into autumn; the season was
waning to its close; the guests at the Rainbows were preparing
to leave—many being anxious to get back to town
to be present at the milliners’ great openings and examine
the new styles in fall bonnets.</p>

<p class='c007'>In truth, Mr. and Mrs. Goldsborough were not very
sorry to see their party breaking up. It had not, indeed,
afforded them that full measure of satisfaction
which their princely hospitality deserved. Two circumstances
especially annoyed them—the growing friendship
between their sole heiress, the fair Alberta, and the
Signior Vittorio, a penniless young Italian professor, who
was also a guest at the house, on the one hand, and the
manifest attachment between their nephew Albert and
Farmer Fielding’s pretty daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>And very much relieved they were when the sensitive
young Italian—who was neither adventurer nor fortune-hunter,
nor willing to be considered such—feeling the
social atmosphere near the presence of his entertainers
rather chilly, took the hint that his welcome was worn
out and bowed his adieus; and also when Farmer Fielding
placed his little girl on her pony and carried her off
to Sunnyslopes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfrida had entreated Britomarte to go with her to her
mountain home, urging that the country was ever most
beautiful in the autumn, when all the woods were clothed
in colors more gorgeous than the robes of Solomon in all
his glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers had declined the invitation with thanks
and with the explanation that her plans for the autumn
were fixed.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Elfrida, with a sigh, left her friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>But what of Britomarte? Where would she go from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>this temporary home? Not certainly to Witch Elms,
since there the doors were fast closed against her entrance.
Where, then, could she go? What means had
she to go anywhere? What, then, were the plans of
which she spoke? And how would she carry them out?
Who could tell? Not even her lover!</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin knew well enough what his own plans were, and
how he should carry them out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days before the day appointed for his own party
to leave the Rainbows, Justin sought a private interview
with Britomarte. He knew where to find her; for by this
time he was well acquainted with all her favorite haunts.
It was late in the afternoon, and he was sure she would
be found on “Lond’s Rock,” a point of land between
Crystal Creek and Bennett’s Bay, extending out into the
Chesapeake—a solitary desert, though so near the peopled
villa, and only frequented by the lonely girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>So down a narrow path leading through the thick
woods that lay below the house, he wandered till he came
out upon the bluff overhanging the beach. Along the
bushy bluff, now burnished bright in the late sunshine of
the waning summer and the fading day, he went toward
the tip of that long point, extending like a giant’s arm
out to the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he approached, he saw that she was sitting on the
rock, with her hands clasped upon her knees, her face
turned seaward, and her black dress was very conspicuous
upon the glistening white stone at the extremity of
the point.</p>

<p class='c007'>So absorbed was she in thought that she remained totally
unconscious of Justin’s proximity until he picked up
her bonnet, which had fallen to the ground, and handed it
to her, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Excuse me, Miss Conyers, but the tide is creeping in,
and, if left there, it will get wet; and even you, if you
remain here much longer, may be cut off from return, for
you must be aware that at high water this point of land
is covered by the sea, with the exception of this rock
which, for the time, becomes an island.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal. I know that; but there is
an hour of grace left. Pray, did you come here to remind
me that twice a day Lond’s Rock becomes an isolated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>fastness?” said Miss Conyers, raising her large, brilliant,
dark-gray orbs to his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Miss Conyers; it was for something more serious—more
important—more imminent, indeed, than that,”
said Justin, gravely, seating himself beside her. “It
would be bad,” he continued, “if the rising tide, before
you should become aware of it, should cover the point
and cut you off from the land, and leave you alone upon
this rock for twelve hours of darkness; but the evil would
be temporary. You are brave enough to overlive it, and
the night would end in morning, and your road lie open
for your return. Britomarte! dear Britomarte!—there is
an isolation more to be dreaded for you, because more
fraught with fatal consequences, than that I have named
could be!” said Justin, trying to regulate the deep emotions
of that passion which was thrilling in every inflection
of his earnest voice. “Oh! Britomarte——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush! do hush, and go away!” she exclaimed, hastily
interrupting him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no—I must speak! I have been silent long
enough! Dear Britomarte, you must hear me now! You
cannot have mistaken the meaning of my devotion to you
in all the months we have passed together here.
You——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor could you have failed to perceive that such devotion
was very unacceptable to me! I thank you, of course.
It was very complimentary to me, no doubt, and I—was
very much honored, indeed. But, as I said before, it was
unacceptable, and you must have perceived that it was
so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte, I love you. Oh! that I could make you
feel the real meaning of the phrase when uttered by truthful
lips. All of life, or death—all of heaven or hell—seem
to hang upon the words, I love you! Britomarte,
from the first moment that I saw you, something in your
face powerfully attracted me. It was not your beauty,
dearest, though you are beautiful; it was something
deeper than that. It was the soul looking from the face!
I love you with my whole heart and soul, once and forever!
And if it were possible that I should lose you,
Britomarte, I should never love again! And now, lady,
I have unveiled my heart before you. I love you as men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>loved in those old heroic days when for woman’s smile
solemn vows were made and deadly perils braved. Now
tell me, dearest, dearest—what I can do to deserve——”
His voice faltered for a single instant, and she took swift
advantage of the pause to answer hastily, and even
harshly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can do nothing! I never can accept your suit!
Pray, to begin with, are you aware that I am a girl of
very obscure birth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is nothing to me, beloved——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That I have not a penny——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have more than enough for both, Britomarte!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, worse than all, that the shadow of a great shame
is thought to rest upon my life!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How should that affect your personal merit, or my
appreciation of it? Come, darling, come! I never can
be less than your lover! let me be more! accept me for
your husband!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For my master, you mean! that is what ‘husband’ signifies
in your laws!” said the man-hater, coldly turning
away, as once more Woman’s Rights throttled and threw
down woman’s love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! Heaven forbid! I could no more be a tyrant than
I could be a slave! My soul abhors both! And if in
your own soul there is one quality that attracts me more
than all the others, it is your impassioned love of liberty.
I sympathize with it, my beloved! I have no wish to
rule over you as a master! I could not, indeed, endure
the love of a slave! Or if one must serve, let it be the
stronger. I wish only to cherish you as my beloved wife,
to honor you as my liege lady! Come, darling!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Woman’s Rights had her heel upon the neck of
woman’s love, and Britomarte coldly answered, as she
walked away:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know, for my part, how, in this age and
country, with the old barbarous laws of marriage still in
force, any sane, honest man can look a woman in the
face, and seriously ask her to be his wife! For their own
honor, I wonder men do not set about and remodel their
disgraceful laws before they do anything else! As for
me, if these days were like the ‘old heroic days’ of which
you just now spoke, when men braved deadly perils and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>wrought great works for woman’s smile, I would have
every woman lay upon her suitor the holy task of reforming
the laws as the only possible condition of her favor!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will take up the gauntlet you have thrown down,”
he said. “I will look into these offensive statutes that
were made, by the by, some centuries before I was born,
and for which, therefore, I do not see that I can be held
individually responsible——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you are responsible for them,” warmly interrupted
Britomarte. “Every man who lives under them,
marries under them, sees women robbed and oppressed
under them, without rising up to oppose them, is as much
responsible for them as if he, and he only, had originally
enacted them!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Granted that this is in a measure true! It shall be so
with me no longer,” smiled Justin. “I will examine
these, and wherever I conscientiously believe they need
reform, I will labor zealously with pen and tongue to reform
them. But, in the meantime, as I cannot give my
whole mind to any subject—not even to that—until my
heart is set at rest, Britomarte, dear Britomarte! be my
wife! and we will labor together lovingly, zealously, in all
good works!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot!—I will not! Do not ask me again! In
the ‘old heroic days’ you are so fond of quoting, a true
knight performed his task before he ventured to sue for
his reward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then?—and then, Britomarte?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did not always get it,” answered the man-hater.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin bowed gravely to her and smiled quietly to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were walking away from Lond’s Rock, where,
indeed, they had already lingered too long; for the tide
was now rising rapidly, threatening to cut off their retreat
from the main.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c005'>BRITOMARTE’S PLAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“But what then will you do, my child? I am an
humble minister of God, even in his beneficent aspect of
Father to the fatherless. As such I invite your confidence;
trust in me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These words were spoken by the old Lutheran clergyman
to the beautiful man-hater, as he bent kindly over
her, holding her hand, on the morning after their departure
from the Rainbows.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were on board the <em>Leviathan</em> and within a few
miles of Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been urging upon her the oft-repeated, oft-rejected
invitation to make his house her home. For the
last time she gratefully declined the offered hospitality.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what then will you do, my child?” he resumed,
seeing that she remained silent and thoughtful. “Your
old grandaunt has most unnaturally renounced you; nor
indeed, if she had not, would Witch Elms be a desirable
home for you. The people that Miss Pole retains around
her, and the rumors that are afloat about the place, make
it particularly objectionable as a residence for a young
girl”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will become a missionary,” answered Britomarte,
stoutly, and neither prayers or commands could move her
from this resolve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Board of Foreign Missions were in want of teachers
to join a company of missionaries whom they were
about to send out to Farther India, and she had made up
her mind to offer her services.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte, after leaving Dr. Rosenthal, went down
into the cabin to put up her effects, to be ready for
landing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie was already there, engaged in making similar
preparations; but as soon as she saw Britomarte she
threw herself into her friend’s arms and burst into a passion
of tears. The prospect of separation from her queen
was almost insupportable to the minister’s gentle child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it were only in pity for me, Britty, you might not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>leave me! I have no mother, nor sister, nor any one
in the world but you! In mercy to me you might come
with me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My darling—no one? Why, you have your father,
your brother, and your lover,” said Miss Conyers, gently
caressing her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! I mean no woman! It is so sad for a girl to have
no woman friend. I feel it so. And yet it is not for
myself either that I grieve, but for you who have neither
father, brother, nor lover, as I have!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, thank Heaven!” exclaimed the man-hater, fervently;
and then, with a softened manner, she added:
“But about your lover, my darling, since you are afflicted
with such a nuisance—tell me, before we part.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I wished to do so. I have no secrets from you,
dear Britomarte. Well, then—we—we are engaged,”
murmured Erminie, with hesitation and blushes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You and—Colonel Eastworth,” muttered Britomarte,
slowly and in dismay. “Erminie, darling, it is customary
to congratulate a friend on these occasions; but I—I
cannot do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Britomarte! you will surely wish me joy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With all my heart and soul, I pray you may have
lifelong happiness, my dearest one!” said Miss Conyers,
with a quivering voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dears, my dears, are you ready to go on shore?”
called Dr. Rosenthal from the head of the cabin stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, papa dear!—Oh, dear Britomarte, think again!
come home with me!” pleaded Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my darling! We must part here. Give me your
parting kiss in this cabin, not on deck before all the men,”
said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie threw herself into the arms of Britomarte,
and clung long and wildly to her bosom, until a second
and a third summons from Dr. Rosenthal compelled her
to let go her hold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the two friends went up the stairs together.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three gentlemen were waiting to escort them on
shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rosenthal placed his daughter in the carriage that
was waiting for her; but when he would have led Britomarte
to the same place, she courteously thanked him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and said that her way lay in another direction, and that
she would go on foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin came forward and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will let me see you safe to the place where you
are going?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, thank you,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin argued, pleaded, insisted, but all to no purpose.
And at last she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Rosenthal, since you compel me to say it, your attendance
would be an intrusion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I have nothing more to urge, Miss Conyers.
We will meet again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘At Philippi,’ ghost of Cæsar? Good-by, Mr. Rosenthal,”
laughed Britomarte, waving her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin bowed and left her, to enter the carriage where
his party were waiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Britomarte watched the carriage drive off and roll
out of sight, and then she drew her black veil before her
face, and walked on her way alone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='c005'>BRITOMARTE EMBARKS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Britomarte possessed a few jewels of value. These she
had never worn or shown. She now took them to a
jeweler on Pennsylvania avenue, and sold them for
enough to defray her expenses to the city from whose
port the missionary company was to sail.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arriving at that city, she found a cheap boarding-house,
and then sought out the secretary of the Board
of Foreign Missions, and offered her services to go as
teacher with the company they were about to send to
Farther India.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secretary required testimonials, which Britomarte
immediately submitted. And then, after a little business
and investigation, her services were accepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers then devoted all her time and attention
to making preparations for a sea voyage that was to last
several months.</p>

<p class='c007'>The missionaries were to sail on the first of October,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>in the great East Indiaman, <em>Sultana</em>, bound from Boston
to Calcutta; but their destination was Cambodia.</p>

<p class='c007'>When her preparations were completed, Britomarte
wrote to her friend Erminie, informing her of all the particulars
of the projected mission, and asking her for the
last news of their own fellow-graduates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quickly as the post could return, Miss Conyers received
an answer from the affectionate girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now that the missionary measure seemed irrevocable,
Erminie did not distress her friend by any vain
lamentations over her own loss. Little womanlike, she
praised, glorified, and rejoiced over her friend, and bade
her Godspeed. She wrote that her brother Justin had
just been ordained a minister of the Gospel, and that he
was to leave them soon for distant duty; but she did not
say where he was going.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, then, our paths diverge forever, thank Heaven!”
exclaimed the man-hater, as she read this part of the
letter, but, indeed, her heaving bosom, and quivering lips,
and tearful eyes did not look very much like thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie farther stated that Colonel Eastworth had
taken apartments at a first-class hotel in the city, with the
intention of passing the ensuing winter there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of their late classmates, Erminie wrote:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is the mischief to play down in Henrico. It
seems Vittorio Corsoni sued for the hand of Alberta
Goldsborough, which was indignantly refused him by her
father. Next he was refused admittance to the house by
her mother; after which Miss Goldsborough, chancing to
meet her lover in the streets of Richmond, coolly informed
him that if they could not see each other in her
own home, they could do so at the houses of their mutual
friends, and at the same time announced that she
should spend that evening with her schoolmate, Eleanora
Lee. That evening you may be sure that the Signior
Vittorio lounged into Judge Lee’s drawing-room to pay
his respects to a former patron.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In this manner they contrived to meet everywhere
where they were both acquainted, until at last, oh, Britomarte,
they eloped! You don’t know how shocked I
was to hear it, and how ashamed I am to have to tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>you! But you asked me for news, and I will keep back
nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They made for the nearest point to cross into Maryland,
where they could be legally married, notwithstanding
she was under age. But Mr. Goldsborough, with
two of her uncles, pursued and overtook them before they
had crossed the boundary and seized both, as he had a
right to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vittorio, they say, was dreadfully agitated, and even
drew his sword-cane in defense of his ladylove. But
Alberta was as cool as ever, and bade him put up his
sword and yield for the time being; for that, though their
marriage was delayed, it was not prevented.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Goldsborough talked of prosecuting Vittorio in
a criminal court for stealing an heiress and minor. But
Alberta calmly assured her father that in doing so he
would only be degrading his future son-in-law, and by
consequence his only daughter, for that she was resolved
to give her hand to Vittorio upon the very first opportunity
after she should become of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whether or not this announcement influenced Mr.
Goldsborough’s conduct I do not know; it is certain,
however, that he did not prosecute Signior Vittorio; but
he brought Alberta here, and placed her as a parlor
boarder in the Convent of the Visitation, where, behind
grates and bars, she is secure from a second escapade.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Goldsborough did not call on us until he had left
his daughter in the convent, and then he only stayed
long enough to tell us these facts before he left for Richmond.
I called at the convent to see Alberta, but was
refused a sight of her. She is, in truth, no less than an
honorable prisoner there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that is not all the trouble in Henrico County. I
have a letter from Elfrida Fielding, in which she tells
me all her secrets with the utmost candor, requesting
me also to tell you, whom she supposes to be somewhere
in our reach.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, who would have thought that wild little
monkey, Elfie, would have acted, in similar circumstances,
with so much more prudence and good sense and good
feeling than has been displayed by our model young lady?
Yet so it was.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Elfie has had a proposal from—whom do you think?—young
Mr. Albert Goldsborough, who was intended for
his cousin; but as she ran away with the flute-playing
Italian, of course he could not be considered bound to
her; so he followed the bent of his inclinations, and offered
his hand to Elfie Fielding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The proposal was in every point of view a most eligible
one for Elfie, and much better, she says, than she
had any reason to expect. The young suitor was handsome,
amiable, intelligent, and possessed a large fortune,
and last and most, he had the favor of his intended—but—he
differed in politics with Elfie’s ‘pap and two unks.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you know what it is to differ in politics in these
days—you have read how gray-haired Senators take each
other by the throat in the Senate Chamber. You have
seen how it sets father against son, and mother against
daughter; how it parts lovers and divides families; pray
Heaven it may not some day come nigh to divide the
Union!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfie’s ‘pap and two unks’ are enlightened, far-seeing
and progressive men. Elfie’s lover is a conservative, and
believes in the eternal stability of ‘institutions’ and the infallibility
of the powers that be, etc. Elfie’s lover, had
he lived in the first year of the Christian era in Judea,
would have been a Jew, and helped to crucify Christ.
Had he lived in England at the time of the civil wars,
he would have been a royalist. Or had his presence enriched
the earth at the time of our own Revolution, he
would have been a Tory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, you know, of course, it is an irreconcilable difference
between Elfie’s ‘pap and two unks’ on the one
hand, and her lover on the other. But Elfie won’t run
away with him, as he wishes her to do. She tells him
plainly that he must convert her ‘pap and two unks,’ or
be converted by them, before she will endow him with
her hand and the reversion of the old gig, the blind mare,
niggers, and other personals to which she is heiress; for,
though she don’t care a pin for politics herself, she will
have peace in the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have here quoted Elfie’s own words. Now, who
would have given that little monkey credit for so much
wisdom and goodness?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“And in the meantime you see Mr. Goldsborough has
his hands full between his cool, determined daughter
and his self-willed, refractory nephew; both of whom,
instead of marrying each other, and keeping the family
estates together, to please their friends, have taken the
liberty to choose partners for life to please themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But after all, as these marriages are not yet consummated,
who knows but that young Mr. Goldsborough
may ‘see his own interest,’ as the phrase goes, and persuade
Alberta to ‘see her own duty,’ as the other phrase
goes, and that they may yet marry and unite the two
great branches of the great house of Goldsborough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, oh, I am wrong to write so lightly on such sacred
subjects. How hard it is, dear Britomarte, to keep from
sinning with one’s tongue and pen! I hope that all these
lovers will be true to themselves, and to God, who is the
Inspirer of all pure love. I hope they will wait patiently
until they win their parents’ consent and the reward of
forbearance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was much more of Erminie’s letter, too much
to quote. Sometimes the effervescent spirits of her youth
would break forth in some such little jest as the above,
and then she would quickly repent and piously rebuke
herself for such levity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her letter closed in one deep, fervent, heartfelt aspiration
for Britomarte’s happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte’s tears fell fast over this letter. This man-hater
would like to have persuaded herself that she wept
over the thought of the lifelong separation from her
bosom friend, or over the frailties of Alberta, or over the
troubles of Elfie, or over anything or anybody rather than
over the memory of Justin Rosenthal. Erminie had written
freely of Alberta and Elfrida and their lovers; but
she had mentioned her brother only to say that he had
been ordained and was going away. And Britomarte
could scarcely forgive her friend for such negligence.
The name that was written in the letter, “Justin,” she
pressed again and again to her lips, while her tears
dropped slowly and heavily upon the paper. Suddenly,
with a start, she recollected herself, and to punish herself
for a moment’s weakness, she deliberately tore up the letter
and threw it away.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>In the omnibus that was to take her to her steamer
she was introduced in form to Mr. Ely and Mr. Breton
and their wives. These, with herself, were the five missionaries
that were to go out to Farther India.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two young women were crying behind their veils.
They were strangers to each other, and all but strangers
to their husbands. One had come from the West, and
one from the South, to marry these young men, and go
out with them to India. They had now been married but
a few hours, after an acquaintance with their intended
husbands of but a few days. In a fever of enthusiasm
they had left all the familiar scenes and all the dear
friends of their childhood and youth, to join their hands
with strangers, and go out to a foreign land, to live and
labor among heathen. No wonder they wept bitterly
behind their veils as the omnibus rattled over the stony
street and under the drizzling sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the pier was a crowd of the church members, consisting
of men, women and children, in omnibuses, in
cabs, and on foot, the latter having large umbrellas
hoisted, all waiting to see the missionaries off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beside the pier was chained a large boat, waiting to
take the voyagers to that magnificent three-decker East
Indiaman that rode at anchor about half a mile out in the
harbor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In less than fifteen minutes they were alongside of the
great behemoth of a ship that lay upon the waters like
some stupendous monster of the deep.</p>

<p class='c007'>An officer stood upon the deck as if waiting to welcome
them, and some sailors were letting down a rope ladder
from the lofty deck to the boat. But to attempt to climb
up the side of that ship by that means seemed like trying
to crawl up the front of a three-story house by the rainpipe.
The two brides were frightened nearly out of
their senses at the bare thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Britomarte volunteered to go first, and she set her
foot on the lowest, slack rung of the ladder, and took
hold of the side ropes and began to climb; Mr. Breton
followed close behind her, to keep her from falling, and
also to keep her skirts in order, and Captain McKenzie
bending from the deck and holding down his hand to
help her up on board.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>So Miss Conyers safely boarded the ship and soon the
whole party stood on deck and waved a last adieu.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two brother ministers who had so far accompanied the
voyagers went back in the smaller boat; but before she
had reached the pier, the signal gun was fired and the
<em>Sultana</em> stood out to sea.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='c005'>A LOVER’S PERSISTENCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was the fifth day out at sea; Britomarte had a stiff
attack of <em><span lang="fr">mal-de-mer</span></em>, but had not been so sick as to be
unable to enjoy the witticisms of the Irish stewardess,
Judith Riordon, or the pleasantries of the good-natured
Captain McKenzie; but the spell of dirty weather that
had ensued after crossing the bar was now over, and
Britomarte climbed the stairs, made her way carefully
across the deck and seated herself on one of the coils of
rope stowed against the bulwarks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes wandered over the scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a grand, sublime and glorious round it was!
This boundless sky! One vast circle of air above; one
vast circle of water below. Not a bird to be seen in all
the air; not a sail to be seen on all the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their own lonely ship was the center of this circle and
the only one within it. The solitude of this scene was
even more stupendous than its vastness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gazing, Britomarte sank into thought, then into dream,
then almost into trance.</p>

<p class='c007'>What past life was the beautiful man-hater living over
again in that self-forgotten reverie?</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever it was, it wrapt her whole soul in an abstraction
so profound, that she did not hear the approach
of a footstep, though that step rang clearly and firmly
upon the deck; nor did she see the form that stood beside
her, though that form sheltered her from the flying spray
that had begun to wet her clothing; nor did she become
conscious of the intruder’s presence until he stooped to
her ear and breathed her name:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Conyers!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She started and looked up.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Justin Rosenthal stood before her, looking tenderly
down into her face.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first shock of surprise she gazed at him with
widely-dilated eyes, as though he had been an apparition
from the unseen world; and she seemed to think that she
was in a dream, or that she had lost her reason. Then,
as the certainty, the reality of the presence rapidly grew
upon her—as she became conscious that it was he, himself,
Justin Rosenthal, her lover and her beloved, that
was standing before her—an overwhelming rush of joy
filled her soul; and before she had time to control her
countenance, this joy beamed and radiated from every
feature of her beautiful face! It was as if the womanhood
kept bound and captive in the lowest depths of her
heart by pride and principle had suddenly burst her
chains and looked forth in liberty and light. It was but
for one instant this womanhood showed itself, for in the
next the man-hater reasserted her supremacy, and put a
strong guard upon her countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” said Justin, answering her various changes of
countenance with a trusting smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You here!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was but a word, calmly spoken; but it told everything.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why are you here?” she demanded, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>But that assumption of sternness came too late. He
had seen the transient flash of an exceeding great joy on
her face, and even if he had ever entertained any doubts
of her real feeling toward him, those doubts were now
forever dispelled.</p>

<p class='c007'>He seated himself beside her, and then answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You ask me why I am here. I am here because I
love you, have faith in you, and hope to win you as my
wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As your slave, you mean! How dare you!” exclaimed
the marriage renouncer, with burning cheeks and flashing
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, Britomarte; but as my wife and equal; and if
not so, as my wife and liege lady, for if one must serve,
let it be the stronger. I have said all this to you before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So this, then, is the ‘distant duty’ you were to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>upon when you were ordained and went from home,”
said Miss Conyers, sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Erminie never explained! It was not like her
to be so reserved with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My sister was in honor bound to keep my secret.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why should your action in this matter have been
kept a secret? It seems to me that honorable actions
need never be kept so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is a mistake. Sometimes they must. My intended
voyage was kept a secret because I thought, if
you discovered that I was to be your fellow-voyager, you
would never embark on this enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That I never should have done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And your valuable services would have been lost to
the mission,” said Justin, with a slight smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eyes flashed fire. She came down upon him with
a trenchant scorn in her next words.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We sailed on Tuesday. This is Saturday, the fifth
day out, and we have not seen anything of you until this
morning! Pray, do you consider it conduct worthy of a
gentleman to come secretly upon the ship, and remain in
hiding like a fugitive convict for four or five days?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I beg your pardon,” said Justin, good-humoredly, “but
you are wrong in your premises. I did not come secretly
on the ship. I engaged myself as clerk to the captain,
who is an old friend of our family. The first day, it is
true, I kept out of sight, lest, if you happened to see me,
you might take flight and go back on the pilot-boat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I verily believe that I should have done so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly you would; and, as I said before, your valuable
services would have been lost to the mission. To
obviate such a misfortune, I have kept out of your sight,
and in the captain’s office, where I occupied myself in arranging
his books and papers until the pilot went back.
After which, as it was quite impossible you should swim
back to the mainland, I did not mind showing myself at
the table. But, unfortunately, you were seasick, and I
could not see you until this morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But was it right, was it manly, was it honorable, to
follow me in this manner?” scornfully questioned the
man-hater.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“Yes, Miss Conyers, it was all that,” said Justin,
gravely. “I told you in the beginning that I loved you
with my whole heart and soul, for time and for eternity;
that I should make it the first object of my life to win
you, letting wait all other business that might be incompatible
with the pursuit of that object. I do not say I
could not live without you, for I have a sound, strong
constitution, and could endure a great deal of suffering
for a great length of time. But I do say that I do not
choose to live without you. So much do I love you, so
hopeful I am of winning you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very arrogant and presumptuous to say so!”
with which she left him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, though he had embarked on the same ship with
Britomarte, had no intention of playing the bore. It was
enough for him just then that she was near. She rarely
spoke to him, and only then with the most frigid politeness.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the days passed away without incident, till, one
morning, the lookout announced land in sight, and everybody
rushed on deck, but only the faintest speck could be
discerned on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an hour, with the aid of the glass, they made out
Table Mount, and in two hours they could see the whole
line of coast, with its bold headlands and deeply-indented
inlets. A few hours more of sailing brought them to the
entrance of Table Bay, under the shadow of Table
Mount.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ship dropped anchor just as the sun touched the
horizon. The sailors were all busy with the rigging.
The missionary party hurried forward to view the novel
scene; but Miss Conyers, though belonging to them,
walked aft, and leaned over the taffrail, to bid good-night
to the last sun of the old year, as he sank beneath the
wave.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin Rosenthal followed her, and stood by her side
for a few minutes, watching in reverent silence the rich
crimson light fading from the western horizon; and then
he said, quietly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is gone! Will you please to take my arm and allow
me to lead you forward? The captain will not send
a boat on shore to-night; but to-morrow morning we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>shall all have an opportunity of visiting the colony. In
the meantime, the view of the town and its vicinity, from
this anchorage, is well worth looking at. Will you
come?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you—yes,” said Miss Conyers; and she permitted
him to draw her hand within his arm, and take her
forward, where all her companions were grouped together,
gazing upon the new sights before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The view, as Justin Rosenthal had truly said, was well
worth looking at. First of all, the bay into which they
had put was vast enough to accommodate any number of
ships, and, indeed, a very considerable number rode at
anchor within it. Before them lay Cape Town, nestled at
the foot of Table Mount, whose perpendicular sides rose
up behind it; while on either hand, like giant sentinels to
guard the entrance of the port, stood the barren crags of
Lion’s Head and Devil’s Peak. A little back from the
shores were sunny, green hills and shady grove trees,
among which, half hidden, stood beautiful villas, built in
the old Dutch style, with flat roofs and painted walls and
broad terraces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The newly-arrived voyagers remained on deck, gazing
on this scene with never-tiring interest, until the short,
bright twilight of those latitudes suddenly sank into night,
and the stars came out in the purple-black heavens, and
the lights shone in the streets and houses of Cape Town.
Then they went below to the supper that had long been
waiting; and afterward they turned in for the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as they were awake in the morning, the whole
party arose and dressed, and hurried up on deck to take
another look at the harbor, the shipping, the town and
the mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So this is Africa!” exclaimed Mrs. Ely, gazing in
open-mouthed wonder upon the scene before them; “and
only think—as long as we have been expecting to get here,
now that we are here, I feel as if I was in a dream.
Africa! Why, law, you know, though I always studied
the map of Africa at school, and read about it in geography,
I never seemed to realize there was such a place.
It always seemed to me only like a place in a story, just
as the Happy Valley, or the Cave of Despair. And I
am sure it is as strange for me to be standing here, looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>at it, as if I suddenly saw before me the Island of
Calm Delight, or any other place that was only in a
book. How queer! Africa!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think your feeling is a more common one than would
be generally acknowledged,” replied her husband. “Until
it is presented to our senses, the Real, like the Ideal,
only exists, for us, in our imaginations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What astounds me,” said Mrs. Breton, “is to see here,
at the most southern extremity of the most barbarous
grand division of the earth, a town with houses, and a
harbor with shipping, so much like the seaports of our
own Christian and civilized native country. Why, law,
only for that great mountain behind the town, and those
two great rocks to the right and left, that stand like Gog
and Magog to guard the port, one might think we were
in New York Bay, and looking in upon some of the old
Dutch quarters of the city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Mr. Breton; “for harbors and shipping
have a certain general resemblance all over the world.
So also do seaport towns. And this town, with its Dutch
style of building, does certainly resemble some of the
older portions of New York. But it resembles still more
the seaports of Holland, with canals running through the
middle of all the principal streets, as you never see in
ours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! canals running down the middle of the streets!
How queer! Like Venice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, not Venice; for the streets of Venice are all
canals—the walls of the houses rising straight up from
the edge of the water. But here the canals only run
down through the middle of the most important streets,
and there are beautiful sidewalks, well shaded by lofty
trees, before the rows of houses, each side. But you will
see all these things when you go on shore. And there is
the breakfast bell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While the others talked, Miss Conyers and Mr. Rosenthal
stood side by side, perfectly silent, and letting their
eyes rove over the sea and land. And now they turned
and followed their companions into the saloon.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they were breakfasting, the sailors were getting
out the yawl boat, so that when they came on deck again,
they found it waiting. They made haste to prepare themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and were soon ready. The gentlemen handed the
ladies carefully down into the boat. The captain, who
was going on shore with his passengers, joined them;
and the sailors laid themselves to their oars and pushed
off the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In African waters—only think!” said Mrs. Breton,
who did not seem to be able to get over her astonishment
at finding herself in such a, to her, mythical place.</p>

<p class='c007'>They rowed cautiously past British men-of-war, past
East India merchantmen, past Dutch traders, past Chinese
junks and the shipping of all nations that rode at
anchor in the harbor; and then past the fortifications,
and past the custom-house, near which they landed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they brought nothing into the town but what they
wore on their persons or carried in their hands, they had
no business with the receivers of duty; so they went on
into the town. First they found the usual crowd that
day and night haunt the piers of seaports—only in this
place the crowd was smaller as to number and greater as
to variety than is commonly to be met with, for here
were English, Dutch and Portuguese colonists, and Hottentot,
Kaffir and other natives, besides a sprinkling of
strangers and visitors from all parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through this crowd they went up a narrow street, and
turned into a broad avenue, beautifully shaded with poplar,
oak and pine trees, and built up on each side with
handsome houses in the Dutch style of architecture, having
gayly painted fronts, flat roofs and broad terraces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the captain paused to point out to them the way
to the South African College, and left them, and went in
pursuit of his own business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Ely and Mr. Breton had letters of introduction to
Professor John of that institution, and thitherward the
whole party turned their steps. It was a long but pleasant
walk. The novelty of everything around them, and the
strangeness of seeing so many old familiar objects of
their own native land and home mixed up with so much
that was new and foreign, beguiled the time, so that they
were unconscious of fatigue until they reached the college
building.</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor was within, and received them in his private
study—a comfortable room, carpeted, curtained, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>fitted up with chairs and tables, desks and bookcases, like
any European or American gentleman’s library.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor John was a pleasant little old man, in a
dressing-gown, cap and slippers. And very cordially he
arose and welcomed the party to Africa.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To Africa!” echoed Mrs. Ely, who seemed in a chronic
state of amazement—“it seems like saying—‘to the
moon.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my dear young lady, it is rather an outlandish
place, and in the same quarter of the globe as the mountains
of the moon!” said the Professor, who was something
of a humorist.</p>

<p class='c007'>He offered them refreshments, consisting of the rich
Constantia wine of the colony, and biscuits, cold fowl,
cake, fruit, and so forth. And, when they had eaten and
drank and rested, he showed them over the college—into
the library, museum, classrooms, refectories and dormitories.
And, when they returned to his study, he sent a
messenger to procure a carriage to take them around the
town.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='c005'>A VILLA IN CAPE COLONY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>From the South African College they drove out of
town in the direction of the Wynbey Hill to a beautiful
villa in the English style of architecture, closely shaded,
with the brilliant native trees of the colony grouped with
the imported old familiar trees of the mother country,
and surrounded with gardens laid out in the English
fashion. To the owner of this lovely home, the Rev.
Mr. Burney, of the Presbyterian Church, Mr. Ely bore
letters of introduction for himself and his whole party.
And when their carriage had rolled through the beautifully
ornamented grounds and up the poplar-shaded drive
to the front of the villa, he left his companions in their
seats and alighted and went in to present his credentials
to the master of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was welcomed by Mr. Burney with that cordial hospitality
which must be peculiar, I think, to colonists all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>over the world; but is perhaps most peculiar to those of
the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>He insisted that Mr. Ely should immediately bring in
his whole party; and to enforce the execution of his plan,
went with that gentleman to the carriage and put his head
in at the window and shook hands with all its occupants,
and then had them all out of it and in his own drawing-room
before they knew what they were about.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he sent for his wife and daughters and presented
them to his visitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mrs. Burney, Miss Burney, Miss Mary Burney.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then he presented his visitors to his family:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Ely, my dears. The Rev. Mr.
and Mrs. Breton. The Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Rosenthal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>—“Miss Conyers—the young lady’s name is Conyers,”
whispered Mrs. Breton, in a panic.</p>

<p class='c007'>But of all the hurried, low-toned explanation the unfortunate
host heard only the names, and he corrected his
mistake and made matters worse by exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless my life and soul, yes! I beg your pardon, sir
and madam.” Then, turning again to his family group,
he presented the young people over again as—“My dears,
the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Conyers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte’s cheeks were scarlet. But Justin smiled
with perfect self-possession and some little amusement
as he shook hands all around, saying as he did so:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not so happy. The young lady by my side is
Miss Conyers; but it is not the fault of Justin Rosenthal,
at your service, that she is so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The good minister uttered another:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless my life and soul!” And then he laughed and
stretched forth his hand, saying: “But you see the mistake
was so natural on my part. Here is a party of missionaries
on the way to India! And here is one young
couple and here is another young couple; and here are
two more young people, and what so natural as to take
them for a third young couple? But I beg your pardon,
Miss Conyers, I am sure!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he ‘won’t do so no more!’—will you, papa dear?”
said Miss Mary, who seemed to be the privileged romp of
the family.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Indeed I will not; until you give me the right,”
laughed the minister.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers responded by a grave, severe bow; she
could not easily recover her equanimity.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Justin begged to assure his host that he, for his
part, suffered under no sense of injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Burney laughingly replied that he should imagine
he did not.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so the affair passed off.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the party were all seated comfortably in the easy
chairs and on the sofas of the drawing-room, that looked
so exactly like their drawing-rooms at home that they
could almost have supposed themselves transported by
magic back to America, their host, with his hands upon
his knees and his head bent eagerly forward, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your ship will be in port here some days, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. We sail on Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless my life and soul!” exclaimed this good man,
who was given to imploring benedictions upon his own
head. “You sail on Saturday, and this is Thursday.
Well, well! You must make the most of your time and
we must make the most of you. You must remain with
us while the ship is in port. Not a word now! I will
take no denial.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor did he, and, indeed, it required very little persuasion
to induce the voyagers to share Mr. Burney’s hospitality.
The intervening days were spent delightfully
in sight-seeing, and it was with real regret they bade the
good people adieu and returned to the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>For two weeks they were blessed with fine weather and
a fair wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, when the moon was at the full, there were indications
of a change. The wind gradually died away, or
rose and blew in fitful puffs, and sank again. The ship,
with all her canvas spread whenever it could catch the
faintest breeze, made little or no progress. The weather
grew intolerably hot and oppressive. The sun blazed
down from a cloudless sky with consuming fierceness.
The ladies were driven from the deck to seek shelter from
the burning heat in the deep shades of the cabin, where
they remained all day, or at least while the sun was
above the horizon. After sunset they ventured upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>deck to seek a breath of fresh air, which they very seldom
found even there, for the atmosphere seemed oppressed
with some deadly element that made it almost
unfit for inhalation. And even the reflected light of the
moon seemed to be reflected heat as well, and Mrs. Breton
declared it looked as hot, and felt as hot, as ever
the sun did in her own native clime.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crisis came; the wind fell lower and still lower;
and then the fitful puffs that had served to carry the ship
forward a knot or two an hour, ceased altogether; the
sea sank; and the ship lay like a log upon the glassy sea,
under the burning sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day and night for nearly a week this dead calm continued
with most depressing monotony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heavens wore an ominous aspect. The sun had
set, and every ray of his light had faded from the western
horizon; yet the whole sky seemed to be illumined
with supernatural light—a bronze-colored glare that
made the moon and stars look pale and dim, and that was
reflected by the sea, until the whole sphere seemed smouldering
on the eve of bursting into a conflagration; while
ever, at short intervals, came that low, deep, distant sigh,
moan or sob, across the waters. As if in sympathetic
answer to this mysterious sound of distress, the ship began
to creak, groan and roll. And the whole circle of the
sea began to boil up into a white foam.</p>

<p class='c007'>The seamen also were very active and busy. Some
were reefing the topsails; some were setting storm staysails;
others were closing the portholes; and others again
were securing the fastenings of the lifeboats.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s something wrong a-brewing,” said Mrs. Ely
to Miss Conyers, as they walked after Mrs. Breton, who
had hurried to the stern where the anxious men stood
grouped around the wheelhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is coming, Captain McKenzie?” inquired Miss
Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not much, I hope, my dear young lady; but I would
recommend you and your companions to go down into
the cabin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even while the captain spoke, the dull bronze-colored
glare grew darker and darker, and in the gloom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>ripples of the sea gleamed in phosphorescent light, and
the air was filled with a sulphurous odor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will there be a hurricane?” Miss Conyers was about
to ask, but in pity for Martha Breton, who was an exceedingly
timid woman, she forbore the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, take me down, please! I know there’s something
dreadful at hand; and I don’t see my husband anywhere
at all! Please, take me down!” pleaded poor Martha.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers would have much preferred to remain on
deck to watch the coming of the hurricane that she felt
was almost upon them; but in compassion to her trembling
friend she drew poor Martha’s arm within her
own, and led her towards the cabin. They had scarcely
reached the top of the ladder before the wind suddenly
arose out of the northwest with a great blast, and then as
suddenly fell, leaving the ship rolling from the impetus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers hurried her helpless companion down
the ladder and into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Britomarte, I know! I know! The captain and
all of them expect a terrible storm! I saw it in their
faces! and see how hard the sailors are at work making
preparations to meet it! And only think, they have not
even thought of supper, though it is past the hour! Not
that I care for supper now! I am too frightened; but I
know if there were not great danger, they would not forget
it, or neglect to serve it!—and, oh! what a blast was
there!” cried Martha Breton, as another gust of wind
suddenly sprang up and blew with great violence for a
few moments, and then again as suddenly subsided.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better let me help you into your stateroom;
where you can lie down on your berth and be quiet; and
no doubt presently the stewardess will bring us some tea,
which I will take in to you,” said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile on deck all was anxious preparation to
meet the danger. Some of the men were aloft, relieving
the masts from everything that could cumber the action
of the ship or be reft away by the wind. Others were
seeing to the chains. Others again were clearing the
deck from the lumber sent down from aloft. The captain,
with two men, were at the wheel. The wind that
had at first sprung up in fierce and fitful gusts now blew
steadily, but with great and increasing violence, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>northeast, driving the ship furiously through the boiling
waves. The sea, risen to a great height, dashed
over the decks at intervals, carrying off all light matter
that had been left there, and threatening at every return
to wash off the crew. So strong and fierce was the wind,
so high and heavy the sea, that it was all the man at the
wheel could do to keep the helm.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the night advanced the tempest increased in fury;
the wind blew in fiercer blasts, howling and shrieking
around the ship, as if all the accursed spirits in Tartarus
had been let loose; had there been a square of canvas up,
it must have been split to pieces; the very masts were
bent like reeds. “Alps on Alps” of waves arose and
broke in death-dealing blows upon the deck; scarcely any
hour passed in which some unfortunate seaman was not
torn from his holdings and swept overboard, and the
utmost precautions taken could not prevent the waves
rushing into the cabin, to the unutterable horror of Mrs.
Breton, who could only gasp and sob, while even Mrs.
Ely exclaimed in affright:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall be drowned! Oh, my Heavens, we shall be
drowned! drowned here in the cabin like blind kittens in
a tub!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, thin, bad luck to the kittens. I wish meself they
were drowned entirely, for sure it was thimselves as
brought this hurricane upon us, as the saymen foretold!”
exclaimed Judith, the stewardess, who had only heard, in
the din, something about drowning and kittens. At
every wave that came rushing in, Mrs. Breton went into
a spasm, and Mrs. Ely cried out for mercy, though before
the words had left her lips, the wave had left the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last one, heavier than any that had preceded it
broke into the cabin, prostrating all its inmates, and then
rushed out again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are lost! Heaven and earth, we are lost!” cried
Mrs. Ely, as soon as she could get her breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, be calm, we are immortal spirits; we cannot be
lost! Think of that, and brace yourself to bear whatever
comes! At worst it will be but a stormy passage
to the other world!” said Miss Conyers, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>But her companions were unnerved beyond all hope
of being strengthened.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>And still, as the awful night deepened, the wind blew
in more furious gusts, bending the masts like rods, the
sea rose in higher waves, beating the ship with mortal
blows; the thunder rolled in louder peals, and the lightning
blazed with a more deadly glare. The ship was
driven furiously through the darkness, and clear out of
her course, and no one on board had any distinct idea of
where she was.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the night of horrors wore on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, for daylight! oh, Heaven, for daylight!” was the
frequently aspirated prayer in the dark cabin. And, “Oh,
for daylight! oh, God, for daylight!” was the unuttered
prayer on the quivering deck.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='c005'>THE ROCKS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>All things have an end. That awful night passed at
last. Daylight came, slowly enough, through the heaped
black clouds that rolled upon the heaving waves below
and reached unknown heights in the sky above.</p>

<p class='c007'>So darkly and gloomily came the morning, that it
seemed not so much the dawning of the day as the fading
of the black darkness. Night grew paler in the
cabin, and the scared inmates could see in the waning
darkness the wan faces of their companions rising up
and down with the tossing of the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>And soon after daylight came that startling cry from
the man on the lookout—that cry which is so often a
sound of rapture or of despair, because it is a herald of
life or of death. Ah, Heaven! it was now a knell of
doom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Land ho!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where away?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On her lee bows!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven!” fervently breathed Mrs. Ely, to
whom the words conveyed no other idea than that of a
good landing place, where they could all leave the dreadful
ship, and go on shore in safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Breton lifted her prostrate head, and ventured to
draw a long breath.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Miss Conyers never moved or spoke; too well she
knew the deadly meaning of the words she had heard—“Land
ho!” “On her lee bows!”—when the ship was
being driven before the wind at such a furious rate.
Silent and breathless she sat, and waited for what should
come next.</p>

<p class='c007'>The voice of the captain rang clearly out above the
roar of wind and wave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Luff! Luff!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Too late! Another instant and the doomed ship was
lifted high on the top of an enormous wave, and carried
forward and cast down with a tremendous shock that
crashed and tore through all her timbers from keel to
quarter-deck, while she shuddered in a death agony, impaled
upon the horns of the hidden rocks!</p>

<p class='c007'>The passengers in the cabin were tossed up and
thrown down by the concussion. They were jarred and
shaken, but not seriously hurt. They quickly recovered
themselves; and all the women except Miss Conyers were
surprised and pleased to find that the ship, which had
been tossing and pitching with such tremendous force
for the last twelve hours had now become nearly motionless.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was a great deal of rushing about and calling
out among the men on deck, and Mr. Ely and Mr.
Breton started and ran up to see what it all meant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter? Have we landed anywhere?
Oh, I suppose of course we have, but with what a stunning
shock! It is bad enough when a river steamer
strikes the pier too suddenly; but I declare this quite
knocked the breath out of my body; and, besides, it was
so unexpected! I didn’t know that ships ever did come
quite up to piers, and I did not even know we were near
any place. What port is it likely to be, do you know,
Miss Conyers?” inquired Mrs. Ely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know where we are. We shall hear presently,
I suppose,” replied Britomarte. But too well she
knew where they were not—in any place of safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anyhow, I am very glad to be still. I know that,”
answered Mary Ely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martha Breton, who was often frightened out of her
senses by slight or imaginary dangers, was now quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>cheerful in the midst of the real and appalling peril of
which she was fortunately unconscious. She got off the
floor and into a chair and began to smooth her disordered
hair and dress and to call out to Judith to light
the lamps; for though it was daylight, it was still very
dark in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you know we have got to dress and go on
shore,” added poor Martha.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, bedad, yes! sure we’ve got to go somewhere,”
wailed Judith; but she got up and lighted the cabin
lamps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the commotion on deck increased. Suddenly
again the captain’s voice was heard above all other
sounds:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Launch the lifeboats!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the rushing of many feet on the deck increased,
mingled with the rushing of many waters around the
ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord betune us and harm, the lifeboats! Mary, star
of the say,” and so forth, and so forth, said Judith, wailing
lamentations and muttering litanies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we to go on shore in the boats? I thought the
ship itself had landed and touched the pier,” said Mrs.
Ely, rising to go to her stateroom to put on her bonnet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I suppose we shall know what port we have
touched sooner or later,” laughed Mrs. Breton, so glad
to know that the ship stood still, and to believe that she
was about to leave it for the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte neither spoke nor moved. She knew, if
her companions did not, that death was imminent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commotion on deck grew furious; it seemed almost
as if a mutiny had sprung up among the seamen;
too well she knew the meaning of that commotion;
the crew were seizing the lifeboats. Again the voice
of the captain was heard near the companionway:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Bates! see to getting the women in the cabin up
on deck immediately—they must first be saved!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers made no reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Saved! Heaven of Heavens! From what? From
what are we to be saved, Britomarte?” exclaimed Mrs.
Breton, suddenly seized with terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How strangely you look, Britomarte! Your face is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>as white and as hard as marble! Oh, dear! oh, dear!
what is the matter? What has happened? What are
we to be saved from? Tell me! tell me quickly!” cried
Martha Breton, wringing her hands in the extremity of
distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Heaven, do you not know, then? The ship is
wrecked on the rocks! The crew are leaving her in the
lifeboats!” said Miss Conyers, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, no, no! Oh, don’t say that! Oh, mercy!”
screamed Mrs. Breton, wild with horror and despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be firm! For Heaven’s sake, be firm! Be a woman!
Let these men see that we can brave death with the best
of them!” said Britomarte, for you see the ruling passion
was “strong in death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care what they see! Oh, dear! oh, dear!”
wailed the poor woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is all this fuss about?” cried Mrs. Ely, coming
out of her stateroom equipped in bonnet and shawl for
her landing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before any one could answer her, there was a rush of
many feet down the companion ladder, and several men
entered the cabin, which was still too dark to enable the
occupants to recognize the new comers. But Judith
hurried out of Mrs. Breton’s stateroom with a lighted
lantern, and then they saw that the visitors were Justin
Rosenthal, Terrence Riordan, and the two young missionaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Ely and Mr. Breton each rushed to the rescue of
his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Riordan hurried his daughter up the companion ladder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin Rosenthal came to the side of Britomarte Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>His face was very pale, but his voice was firm as he
hastily addressed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ship is a total wreck; the crew are about to
abandon her, but they have consented to save the women.
Let me take you to the lifeboats.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go with you on deck,” she answered, calmly
giving him her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other women of the cabin had been taken away
by the men that had come for them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Justin and Britomarte now followed them up on deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>But oh! what a scene of unparalleled horror and desolation
met their appalled sight! The sun was just struggling
up above the horizon through masses of black and
ragged clouds; the thunder and lightning had ceased,
and the wind had died away, but the infuriated sea still
foamed with rage, and rose in mighty waves, and roared
above the ship and fell in thunder over her decks. The
ship, a mere shattered wreck, lay impaled upon the sharp
rocks that had penetrated her keel; her bows were under
water, and the waves dashed over her every minute,
threatening to divide her amidships, but fortunately, her
stern was lifted high out of the sea, and wedged in a
ravine or crevice of the rocks; heavy clouds and fogs
rested on the tempestuous ocean, and no one could see
where the land lay, if indeed there was any land near,
or anything else but this chain of sunken rocks which
had proved a reef of death to the fated ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lifeboats were all launched, and the crew were
crowding into them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain McKenzie stood, pale and stern, by the starboard
gangway, seeing to the lowering of the women
into the boats. Mrs. Ely and Mrs. Breton were let
down into one, and Judith Riordan into the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hand the other girleen down! Sure we’ll save the
women, the craytures! but as for the other passengers,
faix they must take their chance along with the ould
ship itself! troth, they’d swamp us all if we was to have
thim in here,” said Mike Mullony, the carpenter’s mate,
who, in this hour of confusion, worse than chaos, and
horror worse than death, had seized the command of the
boat he was in.</p>

<p class='c007'>On hearing these dreadful words that doomed their
husbands to death, the two unhappy young wives began
to scream and sob and pray to the crew; and to stretch
out their arms in an agony of yearning to those beloved
ones who had grown so dear to them on their voyage,
and who now stood fixed and livid with despair upon the
quaking deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sick at heart at this sight, Miss Conyers turned away
and walked as rapidly as she could up the inclined plane
formed by the leaning quarter-deck, to the stern of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>ship, where she stopped, looking down upon the “hell of
waters” beneath her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin Rosenthal stepped hastily after her and stood by
her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood for a moment silent, livid, and breathing
hard, like an animal spent in a long chase; but in his
eyes burned the intense fire of a love victorious over horror
and despair. Then he suddenly seized her hand and
nearly crushed it in his convulsive grip, as he whispered
hoarsely, in a voice vibrating with the strong passion
of his soul—stronger than death and the grave:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woman! spirit! we are on the immediate brink of
eternity! I love you more than life in this world or the
next! I love you more than all created things in earth
or heaven! Tell me, in this last mortal hour! tell me
before we part—Britomarte—that you love me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked him in the face and met his eye; she raised
her hand and pointed upward, as she answered in a low
and thrilling voice:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall meet there! I will tell you then!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her answer seemed to satisfy him; a ray of joy inspired
and exalted his countenance; once more he
crushed her hand in all too strong a grasp, and then he
stooped and said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come! your companions are all in the boats. Let
me take you to them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are leaving me in the ship! no matter! Come!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do they leave you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no room in the boats! Come! come! there
is not an instant to be lost!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! I will not enter the lifeboat! I will remain
with the wreck! I am not afraid of death at all,” she
answered, with that iron resolution that he seldom ever
saw in any other human being.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it is your duty to try and save your life! Heaven
and earth! there is no time to argue this point! The ship
is doomed! the boats are leaving her! Come!” he rapidly
and eagerly exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My mind is made up! I will share the fate of—the
ship!” she answered, calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Then I will save you whether you will or not!” he
cried, hastily laying hands on her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop! Don’t dare to use force with me, Mr. Rosenthal!”
she exclaimed, in a tone that made his hands fall
from her person as if they had been struck off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Heaven of Heavens! there is no time—not an
instant of time for persuasion! The ship is sinking, I
tell you!” he cried, breathing hard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will sink with—the ship,” she persisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why? oh, why?” he demanded, quickly, scarcely
able all the while to keep his hands off her. “Why?
why?” he pleaded. Perhaps he hoped that in this last
awful hour she would give him a supreme proof of love,
and say that she was resolved to stay to share his fate.
And perhaps “to share his fate” was her strongest motive
for wishing to remain on the wreck; but if so, she
gave a weaker one; she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I would rather at once sink with the ship,
and meet a quick and easy death, than take the chance
of life amid the horrors of the lifeboats. I will stay
here, and wait my fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, before Heaven, I will not permit you to do so!
You are mine by the right of the strongest love man
ever felt for woman, and I will dispose of my own as I
please,” he exclaimed, throwing his arms around her, and
lifting her up as easily as a child would lift a kitten. He
bore her down to the starboard gangway, from which
the last lifeboat was just putting off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop!” he shouted. “Men! seamen! some of you
help to lower her down! Some of you take her as I let
her go! Riordan!—Mullony!—hold up your arms!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bedad, and meself will do that same! Let her go!”
exclaimed Mike, standing up in the boat, and spreading
his arms, to receive the form that Justin was preparing
to lower down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Too proud, or too fragile to struggle with superior
force, up to this instant Britomarte had been quiet
enough; but now, as he was letting her go, she turned
with a half-suppressed cry and clung to his breast. But
he tore her away from that hold, and dropped her into
the strong arms of Mike Mullony. And then, stepping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>back upon the deck, he waved his hand for them to
push off.</p>

<p class='c007'>But oh! what a cry of unspeakable anguish came up
from that boat, as Britomarte started to her feet, and
stretched forth her arms yearningly, longingly toward
him, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin! With you! Take me! My beloved! my
beloved!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But he waved his hand to Mike to take charge of her,
and turned away, white as death.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it was an insensible form that Mike Mullony laid
gently in the lap of Judith Riordan, who, with his own
wife, Biddy, were the only other women in that boat;
Mrs. Ely and Mrs. Breton being in the other one.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Britomarte lay still in that swoon, the boat was
put off from the side of the ship. There were on board
of her, besides the crew and the women, the ship’s doctor
and the supercargo. And oh! in the midst of all their
selfish anxiety for the preservation of their own lives,
and their natural sorrow for their companions left behind
to perish, what grief they also felt in abandoning the
brave ship that had so gallantly borne them through
such a waste of waters; the good ship that had so safely
brought them through such tremendous storms, and that
had only succumbed at last to the overwhelming power
of winds and waves! Aye, they grieved remorsefully for
her, as for a human being, deserted at her utmost need,
and left alone to die.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Britomarte recovered from the deep, deathlike
swoon that had held her life in abeyance, the boat was
some distance from the ship. Her senses and memory
returned instantly with her consciousness. Her first
thought was of her lover—her first act to raise herself
on her elbow, and with her eyes to sweep the horizon
in search of the abandoned wreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, there it was yet—distant and dimly seen—but certainly
there, with the bows under water, and the stern
wedged up in the crevice of the sunken rocks, and the
sea breaking over it as before; while all above were dark
and driving clouds, and all below foaming and heaving
waves. The boat made very little headway over this
heavy sea. Britomarte never took her eyes from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>wreck. As she gazed on all that remained of the good
ship, the sun suddenly burst through a black cloud; and
some shining object on the stranded stern caught the
rays and lighted up the wreck, like a star of hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Save him! oh, God of Mercy, save him!” was the perpetual,
though unuttered cry of her heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Spake to me, ma’am! Look at me!” said Judith
Riordan, coaxingly. “Don’t be setting your eyes out on
sticks, and twisting your head around like Lot’s wife,
looking after that wreck. God save the craytures that
were left behind, for we could do nothing for thim!
Sure this boat wouldn’t howld another sowl! And the
other boats were as heavy laden, and they left the ship
first. And Lord knows what’s become of them, for I
don’t see one of them! though troth, this fog to the
landward swallows up every object, so it does. Ah, well,
thin, sure I have been praying for the poor sinners left
on the wreck, and saying the litany of the ‘Star of the
Say’ ever since we left thim there! And I’ll aven go at
it again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Judith opened her little book and went at it
again, muttering her litanies in a half audible voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers paid no sort of attention to her. She
also was breathing earnest prayers for the salvation of
one left to perish, while she strained her eyes for a sight
of the wreck that was often hidden from her view by the
rising of some great wave that threatened to carry it
down, and as often loomed again through fog and spray
to assure her of its continued existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! if it can but hold together for a few days, some
ship may pass and take him off! Oh, if this dreadful sea
would but subside! Oh, God have mercy on me and
save him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was the constant burden of her thoughts and
prayers.</p>

<p class='c007'>There might have been others left on the wreck with
Justin Rosenthal, but she scarcely remembered their existence;
she thought only of him!</p>

<p class='c007'>There was appalling danger surrounding herself and
her companions in the boat, but she hardly cared for it;
she suffered only for him!</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, in this awful hour of doom, all the depths of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>soul had been opened up, and she knew how strongly,
how ardently, how devotedly she really loved him—how
entirely he possessed her life!</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, the danger to the boat and its crew was
imminent. The sea ran high and heavy, threatening
every instant to swallow them up. The shore, toward
which they were blindly struggling, was covered with
clouds and fogs that might hide, for aught they knew,
more frightful perils than those from which they were
trying to escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>What this shore was, no one had the least idea. For
twenty-four hours before the storm, no observation had
been taken and no reckoning made; and during the
storm, the ship had been driven some hundreds of miles
out of her course, so that no one knew on what rocks she
was wrecked, or to what land this struggling boat was
tending. The wind, that had fallen at sunrise, now
started up from another quarter, and blew directly off the
fog-hidden land. This soon cleared away all the mist
and revealed a rugged, rock-bound coast, more terrific in
its aspect than the sea itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the sea was growing darker and wilder every instant,
and the boat was tossed like a cockle shell on the
mad waves. They lowered the little sail to prevent the
wind capsizing the boat, and they took to the oars and
worked hard through the heavy seas along the shores,
keeping as well as they could off the rocks, and watching
for some opening to effect a landing.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the men had a pocket compass in his possession,
and he took it out and set it, and saw that they were rowing
northward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was sinking down through a bank of clouds
behind the land, when the boat’s crew, still striving with
the wild waves and rowing northward, saw that they
were coming to a point that seemed to be the most northern
extremity of some island.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we can once round that point,” said one of the
sailors, “we can get under the lee shore, and may manage
to make a landing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must give it a wide berth, then, if we double it
at all; the current around that point would suck the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>boat down to destruction in no time,” said another seaman.</p>

<p class='c007'>They turned a little off and struck out to sea, meaning
to give the point with its fatal maelstrom “the wide
berth” that their comrade recommended.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun went down and night gathered, and all was
hidden from her view.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boat’s crew labored on through the darkness of the
night, the beating of the wind and the roughness of the
sea, striving to round that point and get under the lee
short of the land. But as night deepened the sky grew
darker, the wind higher, and the sea wilder. It was a
miracle that the boat lived from moment to moment,
through several hours of that dread death struggle, but
while they strove for life, they expected only death. They
made what blind preparations they could to meet the
greater calamity, when the boat itself should be lost. The
men were strong swimmers, as well as good sailors and
good oarsmen. Some of them took the oars, while
others fastened what life-preservers they had at hand on
the persons of the helpless women.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers objected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pray, don’t,” she said. “It will be but a prolongation
of the death agony. I had rather drown at once
and have it all over, than beat about for hours in this
wild, dark sea, and perish miserably at last.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bedad, though, there’s a chance of life at last! And
sure I promised the masther to thry and save ye, and faix
I’ll do it! Help me here, Terry!” said Mike Mullony,
and with the assistance of Terry Riordan, the father of the
Irish stewardess, he invested Miss Conyers with the life-preserver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not an instant too soon!</p>

<p class='c007'>There came roaring onward an enormous wave that
lifted itself high above and fell with annihilating force
upon them. And in an instant the boat was gone, and
the souls that had intrusted themselves to her were struggling
in the mad sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte almost lost her senses in this shock of
doom; and then she found herself in the wild waters, kept
up indeed by the life-preserver, but dashed hither and
thither, a helpless creature, at the mercy of the waves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>And the night was appalling with the howling of the
wind and the roaring of the waters and the shrieks of the
drowning men and women!</p>

<p class='c007'>In this scene of horror unutterable, Britomarte was
beaten about, now driven out to sea, now dashed in towards
the land; and through all one sublime thought exalted
her soul above all the despair of the situation:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are immortal souls and cannot be destroyed! We
are spirits and must live forever!”</p>

<p class='c007'>At last she felt herself lifted up by an enormous wave,
that, roaring as in triumph over its prey, bore her forward
with great velocity and threw her with deadly force
upon the shore; and with the shock she lost her consciousness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='c005'>LADY ROBINSON CRUSOE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Britomarte awoke from that deadly state of insensibility
into which the tremendous mental and physical
shock had cast her, her recovery seemed like coming
back to life in the grave. At first she did not know what
sort of creature she was, or what state of existence she
had come into. Neither memory nor thought was present
with her. There was only a bodily sense of uneasiness,
as the air again inflated her collapsed lungs, and the vital
current resumed its flow through her damp, chilled and
heavy limbs; and a mortal sense of vague despair, impossible
to analyze.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instinctively she turned over and tried to rise; faintly
she perceived that the palms of her hands were deep in
the moist sand, and that they went deeper as she bore
her weight upon them in her efforts to get up. And
thus she discovered that she was on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, after several fruitless attempts, she succeeded
in lifting herself to a sitting position. And then
she looked blindly around. But nothing was to be seen.
All was dark as pitch. And nothing was to be heard except
the thunder of the sea upon the coast—a sound that
impressed her senses like some dimly remembered knell
of doom.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>She put her hands up to her head, and tried to struggle
forth from this state of mental dullness and confusion.
She tried to think and remember who she was,
what had happened, and how she came to this hades of
darkness and desolation! In vain! as well might a newborn
infant try to recall the events of its pre-existence,
supposing it ever to have had one. With all her striving
to come forth from chaos, she could only arrive at a dim,
mysterious consciousness of infinite loss and eternal despair.
Was she a disembodied spirit, then? Was this
really hell? Had she come to it? And for what sin?
No, but such spirits had not flesh and blood, as she felt
too sensibly that she had.</p>

<p class='c007'>What then?</p>

<p class='c007'>The ceaseless beating of the waves upon the shore was
a familiar and suggestive sound, and troubled her with
glimpses of memory that flitted in and out of her mind
like ghosts in a graveyard.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a trifle that at last struck the electric chain of
association, and restored her to herself. In her blind
movements, she touched the inflated life-preserver that
was fastened around her waist. And instantly, with a
shock of returning life, the whole scene of the catastrophe
flashed upon her memory. And she knew that she was
cast away upon that dreary coast on which the lifeboat
had been struggling all day long, and far into the night,
and on which it had finally been wrecked!</p>

<p class='c007'>But whether this coast was a part of the mainland or
of an island; whether it was barren, or clothed with vegetation;
whether it was uninhabited, or peopled with cannibals,
she did not know and she did not care; or what
deadly perils and cruel sufferings from the ruthless savages,
or from protracted starvation might await her there,
she did not know and did not care.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instantly, with the flash of memory had come the
knowledge of her one great sorrow, the loss of her lover
and her beloved! Yes, in this awful hour of doom, Britomarte
knew that she loved Justin with an earnestness
that outweighed her hatred of his whole sex and her
devotion to the sacred rights of her own.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the cry of her broken heart arose wildly on the
dark air, amid the profound stillness of that strange land!—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>cry of bitter anguish, not for the fate of all her late
companions, too probably perished in the sea; not for
the feeling of her own horrible state of danger and desolation
worse than death, but for despair at the loss of him
whom she loved as only such souls as hers have power to
love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone! gone! gone! Gone out of my way forever!
Oh, this is the sorrow I dreaded worse than all others
in this dark world! the only sorrow I ever really dreaded!
life without him! And now he is gone forever, without
one good word from me to let him know how I loved
him! Ah! Heaven, how I loved him!” She wrung her
hands and tore her beautiful hair, and then flung her
arms on high, and cried out again, in the frenzy of longing:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin! Justin! My lover! My beloved! Where
are you? Where are you in all space? Are you near
me? Can you hear me? Oh, is there no way of piercing
the veil? of getting to you, or drawing you to me? Oh,
come to me! Oh, hear me! I am telling you what no
power could have ever drawn from my lips, Justin, while
you were in the flesh! Justin! I am telling you how I
loved you! How I loved you! I meant to have died
with you on the wreck! I did, Justin! I did, though I
would not confess I loved you! I meant to have died
with you! Oh, why did you not let me? I cannot, cannot
outlive you! Once you said, though you loved me so
much, you could live without me, because you were so
strong to suffer! But I! oh, now I know that I am not
strong. I cannot live without you! and with the memory
of my bitter unkindness to you! Justin! Justin!
Oh, spirit! wherever you live in boundless space, speak
to my spirit!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was indeed almost insane in her frenzy of grief,
remorse and despair. And but for her deep religious
principles, in her fierce anguish she would have run down
through the darkness and cast herself headlong into the
sea, that she still heard thundering upon the beach.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last, exhausted by mental and physical trials, she
sank down upon the ground and covered her face with
her hands, and sat there in mute despair during the remaining
dark hours of the night.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Day dawned in that strange place at last.</p>

<p class='c007'>She lifted up her bowed head and looked around, feeling
in the midst of all her misery the same sort of weird
curiosity that causes a criminal on his way to the scaffold
to look with attention at every object of interest in
the range of his vision.</p>

<p class='c007'>She saw the eastern horizon growing red behind a
grove of tall, dark trees, but what sort of trees they were
she could not tell. She arose to her feet and stretched
her chilled and benumbed limbs and took off her life-preserver.
Her clothing had dried upon her, but it had a
harsh feeling and a stiff set and a scent of the sea water.
Her hair, too, was loose and flowing; combs and pins
had been lost in her recent battle with the waves. But
she cared little for all these circumstances. A feverish
thirst consumed her and she walked on in search of some
spring or stream of fresh water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day broadened over the unknown land, showing her
an undulating and variegated country of hill and valley,
plain and forest. The ground was covered with a
coarse, rank verdure, and starred with many strange wild
flowers. She merely glanced at these as she rambled inland
in quest of a fountain to quench her burning thirst.</p>

<p class='c007'>She walked some distance, fearless and careless of
what unknown wild beasts or wilder men might intercept
her progress and destroy her life. She often sank exhausted
on the ground; and arose and recommenced her
journey, driven onward by the fiery thirst that seemed to
scorch up her very lifeblood.</p>

<p class='c007'>She came to that grove of tall dark trees behind which
she had seen the sun rise in the morning. She found
them to be a grove of cocoa palms, and as she entered
under their umbrella-like shades she was startled by a
chattering over her head; and at the same time a missile
was launched at her, that missed its mark and rolled at
her feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>She stooped and picked it up. It was a cocoanut.
Raising her eyes at the same time, she saw a monkey
perched in the tree above her, grinning and chattering
with mischievous delight, and preparing to launch another
nut at her. So she hurried from under that tree
and out of the way as fast as she could. She carried off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the monkey’s gift with her, thinking that if she could not
find fresh water, she would try to break the nut and
drink the sweet milk.</p>

<p class='c007'>She passed through the grove of cocoa palms and came
out upon a gently declining plain that descended to the
seaside; so she knew that she must have crossed the narrow
point of land and come out at the part opposite to
that upon which she had been first thrown.</p>

<p class='c007'>The upper part of this plain was covered with a thick
growth of what seemed to be a coarse reed or bamboo, or
what might be a species of sugar cane. Britomarte had
never seen the sugar cane growing, and so she could not
judge of it. She broke off one of the straight stems and
placed it to her lips and found it to contain a sweet juice,
which she sucked with avidity to moisten her dried lips.
But this only seemed to increase her thirst; and as yet she
had found no fresh water, nor could she hope to find any
so near the seashore; but with a fragment of rock she
contrived to break the cocoanut and drink the milk. Still
that did not quench her thirst; so she once more turned
her steps from the sea and walked inland, though by another
route than that by which she had come.</p>

<p class='c007'>She entered another thicket of unfamiliar trees, which
were not, however, cocoa palms, but some unknown
growth of that country. It was a picturesque thicket,
with rocks and grottoes, clothed with luxuriant vegetation
that grew in the crevices or wherever there was a
root hold of soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly she heard a welcome sound, the gurgling of
some spring or stream of water. Following the sound,
she came to a rock, from a fissure in which trickled a
small, clear fountain. She hastily made a scoop of her
hand, and caught and quaffed the precious liquid eagerly.
And when she had quenched her feverish thirst, she
bathed her face and hands, and dried them with her
handkerchief, which she found safe in her pocket. While
she was so employed she heard a sudden rush and whirr
of wings, and looking up, she saw that a large flock of
strange birds, of beautiful plumage, had made a descent
and settled among the branches of the trees over her
head. She watched them for a little while, and then
passed out of the thicket, up upon a sort of tableland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>that occupied the center between the two shores of this
long peninsula, as she supposed it to be. She walked on
she knew not, cared not whither. Her burning thirst
sated, and that physical suffering allayed, she again experienced
heavy mental trouble. She walked on in a
purposeless way, until, happening to glance downward
she saw before her a strange looking little animal, in size
and shape not unlike our young native pig. But on being
observed, it started and scampered away. She went
on and crossed the elevated plain and came to another
thicket and passed through it and came out upon the sea
coast again. And here she sat down in the collapse of
despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is only to wander here until I shall be massacred
by the savage natives, or destroyed by scarcely more savage
beasts of prey, or else until I drag out a miserable
remnant of existence, and perish slowly of famine and
exposure, or of sorrow and despair, more terrible than
physical suffering! How long will my strength hold out
to live and suffer? Not long, I hope and pray, since it
would be to no perceptible good end! Ah, well, it cannot
last forever! ‘Time and the hours wear out the
weariest day!’ This is a dreary season; but this also
will pass away. Time is but a small portion of eternity,
and flesh but a transient condition of the spirit; I am an
immortal spirit, living in eternity, and I cannot die or be
lost; and sometime—somewhere—I shall meet him! Let
me think of that and be strong!”</p>

<p class='c007'>While thus she reasoned herself out of her despondency
and nerved herself to endure the horror and desolation of
her condition—a horror and desolation not even to be
imagined by any one who has only known misery in the
midst of their own kind, in the reach of human sympathy—she
suddenly heard a cry—a sharp, wild, piercing
cry, between a howl and a shriek and a wail—a cry of anguish
and defiance and ferocity!</p>

<p class='c007'>She started and listened.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was repeated again, wilder, higher, fiercer than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>She hoped—she truly did—that it came from some
rapacious beast of prey, mad with hunger, which would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>set upon her and make short work of her and of the
“dreary season” she dreaded so much.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was reiterated in almost human tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>How intently she bent her head and listened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ow-oo! ow-oo! ow-oo!” it screamed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Human tones, yet not articulate sounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Och-hone! och-hone! och-hone!” it hallooed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sudden light dawned on Britomarte’s mind. She
knew that these last sounds were never heard off the
“Gem iv the Say,” except from some “exile of Erin.”
She immediately arose and hurried down the beach in
the direction from which the cries proceeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there, upon the sands, dangerously near to the
water’s edge, lay the form of Judith Riordan. The life-preserver
was still around her waist, but she lay flat upon
her back, with her feet and hands raised, kicking and
fighting the air, and her voice lifted and howling dismally.
And with good reason; for she seemed unable to
get up and run away from the spot, and the tide was coming
in rapidly, and with every advancing wave threatening
to overwhelm and drown her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers hurried to her side and knelt down, exclaiming
eagerly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Judith! Judith Riordan! Thanks to Heaven
that you are saved!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yis, thanks to Hivin, and small thanks to any of yez,
laving me here be meself to be drowned entirely. And
where are the lave of yez, at all, at all?” demanded the
Irish woman, crossly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rest of us? Oh, Judith, I don’t know. You are
the first one that I have seen! Oh, Judith! I fear—I
greatly fear—that all the others have——”</p>

<p class='c007'>A huge wave came rolling and roaring onward, breaking
at their feet and showering them with spray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, bad luck till ye thin, why don’t you drag me out
of this, itself? Sure the next one will carry me off entirely!”
screamed Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Judith, poor girl, can’t you help yourself at all?
Are you so badly hurt as all that?” inquired Miss Conyers,
as she took hold of the woman’s shoulders, and
putting all her strength to the effort, slowly and laboriously
dragged her a few feet from the water’s edge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>and let her down a moment, while she, Britomarte,
stopped to breathe and recover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Am I hurt so bad as that? ye ask me. Ye betther
believe that same! Sure and I’m thinking ivery bone
in me body is broke, so I do! Ah, bedad, here come another
say. Sure if I’d been left where I was, it would
have took me off entirely. Och! drag me further out iv
this——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even while she spoke, the advancing wave broke, and
tumbled down, a shattered avalanche of water, at their
feet, covering them with a shower of spray.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it had fallen back, Britomarte once more took
hold of her companion, and with painful efforts succeeded
in dragging her still a few feet farther on, where
she was safe from the tide.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c005'>LEFT TO HIS FATE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And now let us see what in the meantime had become
of Justin, left with his few unfortunate companions to
perish on the deserted wreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>After he had forcibly torn Britomarte from him and
dropped her into the outstretched arms of Mike Mullony,
and had heard her last despairing cry, and had waved his
hand for the lifeboat to be pushed off—he abruptly turned
away that he might not have his resolution shaken by the
imploring words and gestures of her whom he loved more
than life; for he did not know that with the cry still upon
her lips she had swooned away in the arms that had received
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He climbed with difficulty up the inclined plane of the
half-submerged quarter-deck to the stern, which was
lifted out of the water and wedged tightly in a cleft of
the rock at an angle of about forty-five degrees, more or
less.</p>

<p class='c007'>There he turned and stood nearly waist-deep in water,
holding onto the shrouds of the mizzen mast to keep
from being carried off by the waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sea that continued to break over the wreck with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>tremendous shocks, did not, however, rise far above the
foot of the mizzen mast; though every wave that thundered
over the quaking deck shook the wreck to its keel,
and nearly swept the man from his holdings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet there he stood, intently watching the receding lifeboat
and silently praying for her safety, as she labored
through the heavy sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>And even when she was lost to sight, in the deep fog
that enveloped the distant, unknown shore, he continued
to gaze after her, until an enormous wave broke over the
ship, burying him up to the neck in water and almost
tearing him from the holdings where he clung with all
his strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the wave fell back a terrible cry arose from the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, clinging still to the shrouds, bent his head forward
to see whence it came. And to his horror and
grief, he saw a man’s hand and arm strike up for an instant
through the foaming wave and then sink out of
sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great Heaven! Who is it? Which of my friends has
been swept off?” cried Justin, gazing in sorrow upon a
calamity that he was powerless to prevent.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the arm arose no more, and Justin turned his head
to look over the portion of the deck that was still above
water to see what had become of his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were but three of them—Mr. Ely and Mr. Breton,
whom the sailors had refused to receive on the heavily-laden
lifeboats, and Captain McKenzie, whom they
would willingly have taken off, but that he regarded it
as a point of honor to remain with the passengers whom
he was unable to rescue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, looking all over the deck, saw nothing of these
men. Until the moment he had heard the cry of the
drowning man, he had been so much absorbed in watching
the fate of the lifeboat which contained all that he
loved most on earth, that he had quite forgotten his
companions in misfortune. Now, however, he looked
around for them with great anxiety. One of them was
lost—carried off the deck by that last great wave—that
was certain; but which one? Was it either of the two
young missionaries who with himself had been abandoned
to destruction, or was it the brave and loyal McKenzie,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>who voluntarily shared the fate of those whom he
could not save?</p>

<p class='c007'>It was impossible as yet to tell; for, look as he might,
Justin could see neither of his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>He tried to think when and where he had seen them
last, and he recollected that it was on the starboard gangway,
where the three stood near together when the first
lifeboat, containing, besides a portion of the crew, the
two young missionary ladies, was preparing to leave the
ship. He himself had turned away and followed Britomarte
to the stern, and his whole attention had been
given to her until he lowered her into the second lifeboat.
And after that he had seen no more either of the
missionaries or the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now what had become of them? One was drowned;
but where were the others? Justin asked himself the
question, and looked about for the answer in vain. They
were nowhere in sight. They were not on deck, that
also was certain. It was possible that the two survivors
might be in the cabin, which from the position of the
wreck was as yet a place of safety. He called aloud
with all the strength of his sonorous voice, which rang
out clearly above the thunder of the waves:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ely!—Breton!—McKenzie!”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And but the sounding sea replied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fast the waves rolled on.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“McKenzie!—Breton!—Ely!” he called again; but
called in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, the roaring of the sea drowns my voice, I suppose,
so that they cannot hear me; but as soon as it is
safe to let go these shrouds, if the wreck holds together,
I will go down into the cabin and look for them. Great
Heavens! Now I think of it, it must have been McKenzie
who was lost. He must have remained on deck. He
never would have hidden himself in the cabin,” thought
Justin, with an accession of sorrow, for he esteemed the
brave and loyal captain far more than he did the well-meaning
but rather weak-minded young missionaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his eager look after his companions, he had ceased
to watch the waves, and so he had not observed that the
sea arose no higher; that the last great wave was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>climax of its swell, and that now it seemed to be gradually
subsiding.</p>

<p class='c007'>His anxiety to search the cabin was now greater than
ever; for he “hoped even against hope” to find the good
and brave Captain McKenzie safe within its shelter. He
waited and watched his opportunity to try to reach the
cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the sea had gone down a little, and the waves
came with less force, but long before it was quite safe for
him to leave his holding, he let go the shrouds, and began
to climb the inclined deck, holding by anything that
he could lay his hands on, until he reached the cabin door.
It was a feat of gymnastics to get down the companion
ladder, and when he had safely reached the bottom, he
inadvertently lost his footing, and slid all the way down
the leaning floor, until he was stopped by the opposite
partition.</p>

<p class='c007'>There he arose to his feet, stood ankle deep in water,
and looked around. But he could see nothing; it was
nearly dark in the cabin, the dead lights being up, as they
had been put at the commencement of the storm. He
listened; but he could hear nothing except the beating of
the waves that still broke over the wreck, though with
decreasing force. Again he called out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“McKenzie! Breton! Ely! Where are you? For
Heaven’s sake, answer!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was no reply. His anxiety became intolerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>He climbed the leaning floor again, and scaled the companion
ladder, and with great difficulty succeeded in taking
down the dead-lights and letting daylight into the
cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he returned to the cabin, and clearly saw its condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the foot of the ladder, the floor inclined at an angle
of about forty-five degrees. The highest part near
the ladder was free from water, commenced around the
pedestal of the center-table, and became deeper as the
floor was lower, until at the partition wall it was two
feet deep. The chairs and all the movable furniture had
slidden down the sloping floor, and lay half submerged
and piled against the wall. The doors of the staterooms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>were open, and the furniture within them was in the utmost
confusion. And yet everything there—the women’s
clothing, hanging on the pegs or dropped upon the berth;
the little workbasket fallen upside down upon the floor;
the scattered books, the flute—all was suggestive of life;
but it was of desolate life, for all was chaos—still life,
for not a living creature was to be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>A shock of alarm, almost of conviction, that his three
companions had been lost, struck like an icebolt through
his heart. He went into all the staterooms, one by one.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all exhibited the wild disorder he had partly seen
through the open doors; not only that of small sleeping
apartments hastily evacuated, but that consequent upon
the hurricane. The two staterooms to the right and left
of the companion ladder, being in the highest part of the
leaning cabin, were comparatively dry; the other two,
lower down, were partly submerged.</p>

<p class='c007'>No human being was to be found, either; but on the
upper berth of the spare staterooms lay Judith Riordan’s
cat, quietly and comfortably nursing her three kittens.
On seeing Justin’s face leaning over, she began to purr
with delight. What a contrast was this picture to all the
desolation around?</p>

<p class='c007'>But Justin turned away, sick at heart, to prosecute further
what he felt would be a vain search for his missing
friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dining cabin was on the deck above, but it had
been so continually swept through by the tremendous seas
which had broken over the ship, that it seemed scarcely
possible any living creature should have found refuge
there; yet as a forlorn hope, he went thither to seek
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what a scene of destruction met him there!</p>

<p class='c007'>The sea, that had fallen considerably, no longer swept
through it, but everything was shaken together in the
maddest medley. The table which had been laid for the
supper which poor Mrs. Breton so greatly lamented the
loss of, was standing in its place, for it was a fixture, and
the glasses that were fitted in the swinging rack above the
table were also safe, but everything else was thrown out
of place and smashed to atoms, or piled up in the lowest
part of the leaning floor. In the highest part of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>cabin were two doors, leading into two large staterooms;
the right-hand one as you stood facing them was the captain’s
private room, the left-hand one was the doctor’s.
Justin opened the door of the captain’s room, but found
it unoccupied. A sound of pitiful whining and barking
came from the doctor’s room. Justin opened the door,
and found the doctor’s little dog, who leaped upon him
with the wildest demonstrations of delight, but otherwise
this room, like the captain’s, was unoccupied.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now the anxious dread became a fatal certainty—his
companions were all three lost!—swept from the deck
by that last overwhelming wave! But yet, stay—one
hope remained. They were not on the wreck, that was
certain; but they might have been taken off at the last
moment by the first lifeboat that had left the ship. They
might have been so taken off without his knowledge, for
he had left them standing on the starboard gangway,
near the boat in which the two young wives were wildly
pleading with the crew to save their husbands; the two
young missionaries shaking with agitation in this crisis of
their fate, and the captain pale with passion, and stern in
his determination to share the fate of his abandoned ship
and passengers. So he had left them to follow Britomarte
and take her to the other boat, and he had not
seen them since!</p>

<p class='c007'>They might have been saved by the relenting boat’s
crew, but, if so, who was the castaway that he had seen
and heard in the uplifted arm and voice for one instant
before he—the castaway—was whelmed in the sea?</p>

<p class='c007'>Again came the overpowering conviction—it was the
brave McKenzie who was lost. The young missionaries
had probably been taken off at the prayers of their wives;
for sailors have a soft place in their hearts, or heads,
for the woes of women, and will risk much to alleviate
them; and so they had probably consented to risk the
swamping of their heavily-laden boat by the additional
weight of the two young husbands rather than listen to
the sobs and cries of the two heartbroken young wives.
But Captain McKenzie had chosen to remain on the
wreck with his one abandoned passenger—Justin Rosenthal;
and he—the gallant McKenzie—had been swept off
the deck and was lost!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Such was the conclusion that Justin came to. And at
the thought he sat down and dropped his head upon his
hands and sobbed aloud; for, you see, as I have often
said before, the bravest are always the tenderest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor’s little dog, unable to endure such an appalling
sight, to him, as a man’s distress, jumped and
whined around him in sympathetic grief and terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length Justin lifted up his bowed head and tried to
bring reason and religion to the relief of his great regret.
He reflected that the death of so good a man could
but have been a quick passage to eternal bliss—a blessed
fate compared to that which awaited himself, left to perish
slowly on the abandoned wreck, or that which attended
the fugitives in the boats, exposed to battle with
the elements, and perhaps with hunger and thirst for
days, upon the bare chance of saving their lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Somewhat strengthened by the first clause of his reflections
upon the eternal destiny of the brave and good
captain, and very much distracted by the counter-irritant
of his anxiety for the fate of the lifeboats, Justin Rosenthal
arose to leave the dining cabin, the little dog jumping
and barking around him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as he went out on deck, the sun broke through a
mass of black clouds, and striking upon the brasses of
the stern, lighted up the whole wreck in a perfect blaze
of glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the same “star of hope” that had been seen by
Britomarte, from the lifeboats, just before the wreck disappeared
from her view in the distance. For it must be
remembered that the wreck, being much the larger object
of the two, and being hoisted high upon the rocks,
was visible to the boat’s crew long after the boat was lost
to Justin’s sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>By noon the sea had fallen so much that the whole
length of the deck from stem to stern was above the
water; and Justin was enabled to take note of the actual
condition of the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>She remained in the same position, her stern lifted
high and wedged tight in the crevice of the rocks, and
her deck inclined at a great angle. Her bows were very
much broken and her keel was gored by the sharp points
of the rocks upon which she had struck and where she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>was fast fixed. Her hold must have been full of water,
which would have sunk her but for the fact that she
was high and fast upon the rocks; that with the rise and
fall of the waves the large leaks let out the water as easily
as they let it in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin went down to the lower deck and examined the
forecastle, which he found in an even greater state of
chaos than the cabin and the saloon had been. Everything
was saturated with sea water.</p>

<p class='c007'>From there he went into the storeroom, which he found
in the same condition. All the provisions that could be
hurt by salt water were totally ruined—except a few articles
that, being in water-tight receptacles, remained uninjured.</p>

<p class='c007'>Feeling faint from long fasting, Justin broke open a
tin canister of biscuits and sat down to satisfy his hunger
upon that dry fare. The little dog that had trotted
after him wherever he went, as if afraid of being left behind,
now stopped and stood on his hind legs and began
to beg as his poor master, a little Dutch doctor, had
taught him to do. Then, perceiving that his new master
did not notice him, he began to expostulate in short,
impatient barks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin threw him some biscuits, and, leaving him to
nibble them, went to the upper deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>How rapidly the sea had fallen! The jagged rocks
upon which the bows of the ship rested were laid bare.
The wind had changed, and blew directly off that distant,
unknown shore, rolling the fogs out to sea and towards
the wreck. While Justin strained his eyes to make
out, if he could, what sort of shore it was, he felt something
rub against his ankles and heard a mew.</p>

<p class='c007'>He glanced down and saw the poor cat, who was rubbing
her furry sides against his limbs, and mewing piteously,
and gazing up into his face with that helpless, appealing
look with which the brute creation in their need
seem to pray to the human for relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor little animal!” said Justin, stooping, and gently
stroking her fur. “Poor little companion in wretchedness!
You look up in my face with your perplexed eyes,
as if you think I have the power, and ought to have the
will, to help you. But you are half famished, and I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>nothing but a biscuit to give you. And, as you are not
granivorous, it is not your natural food.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And he broke up the biscuit and scattered the pieces on
the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>And pussy, granivorous though she was not, pounced
upon the fragments as if they had been so many young
mice, and devoured them all before she returned to her
kittens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Justin found his way to the cabin, and threw himself
upon one of the berths in Britomarte’s abandoned
stateroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some hours he lay, not sleeping, but thinking of
her, and praying for her safety. Then, as even convicts
sometimes sleep the night before their execution, he, Justin,
notwithstanding his own great personal peril, and
his excessive anxiety for Britomarte’s fate, fell asleep,
and slept long and well.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='c005'>ON THE ISLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When he turned out of his berth next morning he noticed
that the cabin was entirely free from water, from
which circumstance he judged that the waves had quite
subsided.</p>

<p class='c007'>He climbed up on deck to take a look at the prospects
there. He found that the ship was high and dry upon
the rocks, and that the water in her hold had run out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sky was perfectly clear and beautifully blue; and
the sun shone down upon a sea as calm as the inland lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the pure atmosphere the distant land could be distinctly
seen, with its rugged white line of rock-bound
coast in strong relief between the deep blue sky and deep
blue sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>But as Justin dropped his eyes upon the intervening
space between the land and the wreck, an exclamation of
surprise and joy escaped him.</p>

<p class='c007'>What he saw there was rescue! was safety! It was
what could not have been seen at any other period since
the gale, for at no other such period had the sea been so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>low as it was now. What he saw, then, was an extremely
long and narrow chain of rocks, reaching out
from the distant shore to the point upon which the ship
had been wrecked. It was a natural causeway, extending
from the land far out into the sea. When the sea
was high, this causeway was deeply covered with water,
and thus the ship, when driven so far out of her course,
had struck upon it and had been wrecked. But now the
sea had fallen; and the causeway was above water; so
that any expert walker and climber might pass over it
almost dry shod to the land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin was not one of the sort who stand idle and indulge
in speculations while there is anything to do. He
knew that the first thing for him to do was to try to
reach the shore by that causeway.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew that there was no danger of the ship breaking
up just yet; unless there should be another hurricane,
which was not to be expected, at least until the next
change of the moon. He knew also that while she held
together, the ship afforded a safer place of refuge than
the unknown land might offer; for on the ship there was
nothing to injure him; while on the land he might fall
into the hands of cannibals. And in that case what could
one man do against a whole tribe? Still, he considered,
that unless he would perish in the sea when the ship
should break up, that unknown land, with all its hidden
dangers, must sooner or later be his destination; and he
thought the sooner he ventured upon it the better.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this resolution he went into the captain’s private
cabin to look for a small telescope, which he felt sure was
there, and which he wished to use in surveying the causeway
and the shore. He found it and came out. The
little dog jumped down from the doctor’s berth, where
he had nestled himself in his accustomed place to sleep,
and began barking and jumping up and wagging his
tail by way of a morning greeting to his new master.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin patted his head, and then went out on deck, followed
by his little four-footed companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ship had struck at right angles with the chain of
rocks, so that the starboard gangway was towards the
shore. There Justin stood and, adjusted his glass to
view the far-reaching causeway and the distant land.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>But, even with the aid of his telescope, he could discover
little more than he knew before. He could only
more distinctly ascertain that the causeway was a chain of
rocks leading to the shore—a road that would be covered
with water at high tide, and be entirely bare at low
tide; and that the distant land presented only a rock-bound
and forbidding aspect.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was still gazing, he felt something claw at
his boots, mewing pitifully; and the next instant he heard
a shrill barking, and spitting, and clapper-clawing. And
he looked down to see the cat and dog engaged in a fierce
combat, in which the fur flew plenteously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin separated them, lifting the cat up in his arms,
and giving the dog an admonishing kick. Then he took
them both down into the storeroom and fed them apart.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was busy in this humane duty, he was greeted
by a dismal sound—a prolonged “Ooom-mow!” that he
knew must come from the captain’s cow. He followed
the sound until it led him to her pen, which was between
decks in the stern, a position that had saved her from being
drowned, as the stern was lifted at such a high angle
upon the rocks. Justin had no sooner reached the cowpen,
than he was greeted by a perfect babel of noises from
the animals confined in that part of the ship. The hens
clucked, the ducks quacked, the sheep baa’d, and, above
all, the pigs squealed as if they would have squealed
themselves to death, and their hearers to deafness.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these animals had been saved by their position from
drowning, but they were in great danger of starving.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin went back to the storeroom, and found an ax,
and broke open several boxes of grain; and then went to
the fresh water butts, and drew water, and mixed food,
and carried it to the pens, and fed the famished creatures.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he set a pan of milk in the cabin for the cat. After
which he filled a little basket with a day’s provisions
for himself, and put a pair of revolvers in one pocket and
a small telescope and a pocket compass in the other.
Then he put on a broad-brimmed hat, and took in his
hand a stout walking-stick, called the dog to follow
him, and went carefully down the leaning deck to the
bows of the ship, that were nearly on a level with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>rocks. With one bound he sprang from the ship to the
causeway. The little dog jumped after him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The causeway was high and dry above the sea, and
long and narrow in its course, and irregular and rugged
in its aspect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walking on it would have been very dangerous, either
to a reckless or a timid pedestrian.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Justin was at the same time careful and fearless,
and he and his little companion went on safely
enough, though often slowly and with difficulty; for
often a deep chasm cut the causeway across, and then
Justin would be obliged to stop and consider the best
way of getting over it, and then, with the aid of his
walking-stick, he would have to descend very carefully
down one side, and using his stick for a leaping pole,
throw himself across the isthmus at the bottom, and then
as carefully ascend the other side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes the little dog would follow him well enough,
tripping down the first side, swimming the isthmus at
the bottom, and climbing up the other side; but at other
times when the sides were very steep or the stream at the
bottom very rapid, the little dog would come to a dead
halt, and stand whining miserably, and Justin would
have to turn back, and take him up in his arms, and carry
him over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Justin was two hours in going the distance between
the ship and the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he neared the shore, the causeway became wider
and higher, until it began to assume the aspect of a cape
or promontory, and so it continued to rise and widen
until, almost unawares, Justin, with his dog, found himself
ascending a rocky hill, in character almost a barren
mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this ascent he found his walking-stick of great service
in getting a purchase upon the difficult ground; but
he found his little dog a great trouble to him; for he—the
dog—was tired, and would often stop and whine as
persistently to be taken up and carried as any spoiled
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Justin always indulged him, for he was much too
kind-hearted to leave his little four-footed companion
behind. Another hour’s painful toil brought Justin to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the top of the mountain, which he judged to be about a
thousand feet above the level of the sea. The summit
was as bare of vegetation as the ascent from the causeway
had been; so that Justin, from his point of observation,
had a very extended view of the landscape. He took out
his telescope, adjusted it, and took a sweeping view
around the horizon.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found that the land was on all sides surrounded by
the sea, and that he was on an island oblong in shape, and
as well as he could judge, about twenty miles in length
by about ten in its utmost width.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lofty hill, or mountain, upon which he stood, was
the highest point upon the island, and was situated near
the southern end—the long causeway upon which the
ship had been wrecked being the extreme southern point.
And, though this mountain was barren on the side descending
towards the interior, it was fringed with beautiful
trees and gemmed with sparkling fountains. The
center of the island was very luxuriant in tropical vegetation.
Towards the extreme north the land descended
and narrowed to a sandy neck of not more than a mile in
width from sea to sea; but this neck was thickly wooded
with the tall and graceful cocoa palms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having observed so much, and the time being now
about two hours after noon, Justin, who was “sharp set,”
from his long and toilsome walk along the causeway and
up the mountain, sat down and emptied his basket in
preparation for his midday meal. It was but a simple
luncheon of cold bacon, ship biscuit and milk, but he and
his little dog enjoyed it very much.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having finished his meal, he began to descend the
mountain, with the purpose of exploring the island as
far as he could that afternoon, and of spending the night
upon it, if he should find a convenient place of repose.</p>

<p class='c007'>He designed to return on the next morning to the ship
to feed the animals and make preparations for bringing
away all that was likely to be useful to him in this strange
land, which he foresaw would probably be his home for
as long as he should live in this world.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the aid of his stick he slowly descended the difficult
mountain side. About half way down he stopped
at a fountain to assuage his thirst. The little dog, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>had kept close to his heels, followed his example, and
lapped lower down the stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Justin resumed his journey, and continued it
without interruption until, near the base of the mountain,
the little dog startled a covey of splendid oriental birds
that burst up from their cover, deafening him with their
explosive cries, and dazzling him with their gorgeous
colors, so that the whole thing affected him something
like the sudden letting-off of fireworks would have done.
The little dog took the affair as a personal affront, and
continued to bark himself hoarse long after the winged
fireworks had disappeared in the distance. Justin pacified
him at length, and they went on. As they reached
the foot of the mountain, the sun sank behind the horizon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin sat down to rest and reflect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Night before last on the deck of the ship, scudding
before a terrible hurricane; last night alone upon the
wreck, in the midst of the stormy sea; to-night on an
unknown and what seems to be an uninhabited island.
What next, I wonder! Well, I earnestly thank God that
my life has been preserved! But what has become of
her—of Britomarte, whom I forced to leave the ship?
Oh, would to Heaven I had permitted her to remain!
She would have been even now by my side! And now—where
is she? Where? Shall I ever meet her again on
this side of the grave? Ah, Heaven, who can answer
any of those questions?” he groaned, and unable longer
to sit still, he got up and walked forward, still followed
by his faithful little four-footed friend. He walked on
and on through the woods at the foot of the mountain,
while twilight deepened into night, and the stars came
out in the purple-black sky; then he sat down and rested
for a little time, while the dog coiled itself up and went
to sleep at his feet. Then he got up again and resumed
his walk, followed still by his sleepy but loyal little adherent.</p>

<p class='c007'>He walked on until the moon arose, when he discovered
that he had come out upon the seacoast, through the grove
of cocoa palms that he had seen from the mountain top.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='c005'>A MEETING BY MOONLIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Britomarte conducted her frightened companion to the
thicket of woods and grottoes where she had found the
spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>She made her sit down on a fragment of rock under
a spreading tree, and then she went to the spring and
found a large leaf, which she doubled up in the form of
a cup, and caught some water, which she brought to the
woman, who drank it eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, thin! bless the Lord for giving us water itself!
Sure, there’s nothing like it, at all at all, whin the thirst
is upon one!” said Judith, gratefully, drawing a long
breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte brought some wild plums and cocoanuts
which she saw growing, and gave them to Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first the woman was too frightened by the chattering
of monkeys and the growls of hidden forest fiends to
open her mouth; but Britomarte overcame her fears and
she ate and drank with avidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers made a meal of the plums she had gathered.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Judith, now that her appetite was satisfied, found
another source of trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, the sun is setting, and it will soon be dark!
And Lord kape us, where will we slape?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a lovely summer evening, Judith. And there is
a deep, dry grotto in the thicket that we have left. We
will stay here through the twilight, and through the dark
hours before moonrise, and then we will go to the grotto
and sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And there they sat through the short twilight, and
through the long, dark hours that intervened before the
moon arose. The moon arose, a glorious, golden globe,
illumining with its rich, soft light the broad expanse of
sea, and the strange, wild land, with its stately palm
trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte sat gazing with something like calm enjoyment
upon the exceeding beauty of the scene. Sleeping,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>or forgotten in this quiet hour, seemed all her sorrows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith gradually fell to nodding and snoring.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was awakened with a vengeance.</p>

<p class='c007'>A grim footstep came crunching through the pebbles
on the beach.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a scream, Judith started to her feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers also arose and listened.</p>

<p class='c007'>And almost at the same instant Justin Rosenthal appeared
before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord kape us—it’s his sperit!” gasped Judith, who
was too panic-stricken to turn and fly; but stood with
her face blanched as white as snow, and her mouth and
eyes distended with terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost as much amazed stood Justin and Britomarte,
gazing upon each other in incredulous astonishment and
unspeakable joy! For an instant they stood thus, and
then their joy broke forth:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Saved! Oh, thank God! thank God!” exclaimed Justin,
holding out his arms toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She extended her hands. She could not speak; the
overwhelming tide of joy had deprived her of the power.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he caught her to his bosom; and she dropped her
head upon his shoulders, and burst into a passion of tears
and sobs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my own! my own!” he cried; “my beloved! my
peerless treasure! This is the very happiest moment of
my life! How cheaply purchased with shipwreck and
the loss of everything else!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still she sobbed upon his shoulder, unable to make any
other reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are with me! I have you, and I care for nothing
that can befall me that does not part us!” he continued.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’m left out in the cowld entirely,” said Judith,
who had gradually recovered from her panic, and recognized
the apparition as Mr. Rosenthal in the flesh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte! Love! love! Do you know how happy
I am? Speak to me, love! I have not heard the sound
of your voice yet, except in sobs. Speak to me, my own,
only love!” whispered Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I am so glad, so glad, that you are saved! Oh,
thank God! thank God! Oh, in what words can I thank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>God enough!” exclaimed Britomarte, with an emotion
that shook her whole delicate frame.</p>

<p class='c007'>He caught her closer to his bosom, and bent down his
head over hers until his lips touched her forehead and
his auburn locks mingled with her dark brown tresses.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God bless you for every sweet word you have spoken,
oh, my dearest! my dearest!” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was not until her great passion of joy had somewhat
exhausted itself that she recollected herself, and
gently attempted to withdraw from his embrace.</p>

<p class='c007'>But of course he held her fast; until at length she said,
ever so kindly, but ever so firmly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me go, please. I am not quite sane, I think. Oh,
I am so glad, so glad you are safe! Thank God with
all my heart and soul! Oh, thank Him forever and
ever! I do not care that I am shipwrecked on this foreign
shore now!” she added, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I; not one whit. I rather like it,” agreed Justin,
as he sat her down upon a ledge of rocks and took a seat
by her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No more would I, if I had Fore Top Tom foreninst
me, and daddy, and could get me tay, and toast, and mate,
and granes rigalar,” muttered Judith, dropping into her
old place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was so overjoyed to see you safe, that I forgot to
ask how you were saved, or where your companions are,”
said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My companions! Ah, Mr. Rosenthal, how selfish I
was to forget them for a moment! They are all lost!
Our boat foundered in that last gale! Only myself and
Judith Riordan chanced to be saved by having life preservers
on, and by being cast ashore by a wave. Our
companions are lost!” said Britomarte, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost!” repeated Justin, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>And a deep silence fell between them—a reverential
silence in tribute to the dead, taken away so awfully; a
long silence, broken at length by the voice of Judith, who,
reminded of her losses, recommenced her howling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost!” again repeated Justin. “Well, God’s will be
done. All our grief will not restore them to us. And,
much as I lament the calamity, I am too happy in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>hour of reunion with you to feel inconsolable at any circumstance
whatever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How were you saved? Though I am so glad to see
you saved that I have scarcely room to feel curious about
the manner,” said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the storm was over, and the wind and the waves
had fallen, the ship was left high and dry upon the rocks,
in a crevice of which the stern was tightly wedged.
These rocks formed the extremity of a long chain, or
natural causeway, extending from the land far out into
the sea. When the subsiding of the sea left this chain
bare, I passed over it to the land. And here I am—your
lover and servant, to work for you and defend
you, through life and unto death!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Again and again, and forever and forever, thank God
that you are safe! But for the rest——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She paused and hesitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, for the rest—for the rest, Britomarte?” he
eagerly repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do not speak of it now, or here! It would be scarcely
generous or like yourself to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would not be like myself to do anything repugnant
to your feelings!” said Justin, a little abashed; then recovering
his self-possession and dignity, he added, slowly
and thoughtfully, as if he weighed every word before he
uttered it:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We three persons—being two women and one man—are
cast here upon this unknown and uninhabited island,
where we may remain for years, or even for the term of
our natural lives; for, however little we do know of it,
we know that it is out of the course of ships, since our
own ship was driven very far out of her course before
she was wrecked upon its shores. There are no habitations
here, nor any of the commonest conveniences of
human life. All these have to be provided by labor—hard
manual labor, such as women cannot perform—such
as men only can accomplish. This being so, Miss Conyers,
while ever we remain together on this island,
whether it be for years or for our lives, I will serve you
with all the honor a subject owes his queen, and all the
love a brother bears his sister. Let us close hands upon
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“Willingly,” said Britomarte, giving her hand. “Be—not
my subject, for that savors too much of the old folly—but
be my brother, and as my brother I will love and
honor you infinitely! I will pray God to bless you always.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Agreed! But this compact is to last so long as we
remain on this island,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And when we are rescued, if ever we should be; when
I see you among your friends again—if ever I should see
you so—then, Britomarte—then I shall sue for some
nearer and dearer tie than that which unites the most
loving brother and sister!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Rosenthal! Justin! why will you advert to this
forbidden subject? I esteem and honor you beyond all
men, because you are an exceptional man! but I tell you
I esteem and honor you only as a good and noble brother!
In no other light can I ever regard you. You know what
my principles are, and what my frequent declarations
have been: that I never will become the wife of any man
while the present unjust laws of marriage prevail,” said
Miss Conyers, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>And while she spoke these cold words, the sound of
other words—uttered in her wild agony, at that bitter
moment of parting were echoing through his memory—“Justin!
Justin! With you! My beloved! My beloved!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And he saw again the outstretched arms and the wild,
appealing gaze with which she hid uttered them. Had
she forgotten them? or did she wish to ignore them? He
could not tell. But he felt, of course, that honor and
delicacy forbade him to allude to them, or even to the
joy with which he received them—all these circumstances
being “proof as strong as Holy Writ” that she loved him
as no sister ever loved a brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now he answered her cold words as calmly as she had
spoken them:</p>

<p class='c007'>“While we remain on this island I will never even ask
you for a promise or a hope of the sort; and this is the
last time I will ever allude to the subject. But now you
should have some repose. I can understand why you
should deem it prudent to watch the night out rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>sleep, in this strange land, which might, for aught you
knew, be infested with wild beasts; but now that I am
here to defend you, there is no reason why you should
not sleep in peace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was not afraid to go to sleep,” replied Miss Conyers,
a little proudly; “but my companion here refused to go
into the shelter that I proposed, and I did not think it
right to leave her alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was like you to think of others first; but now you
can both seek shelter and sleep while I watch. There is
a fine grotto that I passed in my rambles over the island,
which I think would afford you a safe place of refuge for
to-night. To-morrow better shelter shall be provided.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you earnestly,” said Miss Conyers. “That
grotto was the place of shelter I first wished to go to.
Come, Judith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, and I’ll not budge a fut unless the gentleman
promises to stand at the hole all night to keep off the
wild bastes!” said the woman, defiantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I promise that, Judith. I had a good night’s rest on
the wreck last night, and so I can very well afford to lose
this night’s sleep,” replied Mr. Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte objected strongly to Justin’s proposed
watching; but he succeeded in convincing her that he
could watch without inconvenience. And so they all went
to the grotto in the thicket.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin spread his greatcoat on the floor to make a bed
for Britomarte, and then he bade her good-night, and
went out and took up his stand as sentinel before her rude
bower.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='c005'>MAKING THE BEST OF IT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With the earliest dawn of morning Justin withdrew
from his post and went and gathered some loose, dry
sticks, and piled them up before the hole of the grotto,
and but a short distance from it. Then he took some
matches that he had brought in his pocket, and kindled a
fire to protect Britomarte and her attendant from the approach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of any beast of prey; for it is well known that no
wild animal will ever venture to come near a fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then leaving his sleeping charge, he took up his stout
walking staff and hurried away as fast as he could go in
the direction of the causeway. His wish and intention
was to go to the ship and procure some provisions for
Britomarte’s breakfast, and to return with them to the
grotto before she should awake and miss him from his
post.</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowing now the way so well, and being relieved from
the trouble of looking after the little dog, that he had
left sleeping at the feet of Britomarte, he made much
faster progress over the distance between the island and
the ship than he made on the preceding day.</p>

<p class='c007'>He plunged straight ahead through the thicket, without
the slightest regard to briers and brambles. He passed
over the mountain with more haste than care; but finally
he reached the landward end of the causeway with safety
as well as with swiftness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he set out to walk across the causeway to the ship.
He hurried on without much respect to discretion, dropping
himself down the steeps; with the aid of his walkingstaff,
which he used as a leaping pole, flinging himself
across the chasms; and running on all the level places
until he reached the ship and jumped upon the leaning
bows, which were down upon the level of the causeway.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found the ship very much in the same condition in
which he had left it, and in which it might remain for an
indefinite length of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found also plenty of work to do, and he hastened
to do it. First of all, the poor cat met him on the deck,
with every demonstration of delight a dumb creature
could make. That was his welcome. But, of course, she
had lapped up all the milk he had left for her in the
cabin, and she wanted more.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went immediately to the pens to look after the condition
of the animals, and he found that they also had
consumed all the provender he had placed there for them,
and they were clamorous for a new supply. He hastened
to the storeroom and mixed mashes and brought to the
pens and fed all the creatures plentifully. Then he milked
the cow and fed the cat. For even in his eager impatience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>to get back to the island with provisions for his own suffering
love, he could not neglect the sacred duty of relieving
the wants of these poor dumb brutes, which were
so utterly helpless and dependent upon his kindness.</p>

<p class='c007'>These duties faithfully discharged, he passed into the
storeroom to attend to the business upon which he had
especially come. He looked up a large basket with a
cover, and he proceeded to fill it with parcels of tea,
coffee, sugar, biscuit, butter, bacon, pepper and salt, and a
bottle of milk. Next he went to the pens again and
found the hens’ nests, and collected about a dozen fresh
eggs, which he also added to his store.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he ascended to the dining-saloon, and from the
mounds of <em>debris</em> there he picked out a few knives, forks
and spoons, and cups, saucers and plates, that had escaped
the general crash, and put them in with the provisions.
And he took a tablecloth and folded it and laid it over all
the contents of the basket, which was now quite full, and
upon which he shut down and fastened the cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next he went down into the caboose and looked up a
teakettle, a fryingpan, a teapot and a coffeeboiler, and
tied them together by the handles and hung them upon a
pair of tongs, which he slung over his left shoulder. And
with his heavy basket of provisions on his left arm, and
the handle of the tongs in his left hand, and his stout
walkingstaff grasped in his right hand, he left the wreck
and set out upon his return to the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte was up and about when he returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-morning, sister; I hope you rested well,” was his
cheerful, smiling greeting, as he carefully set the basket
down and dropped the cooking utensils, and stretched his
cramped arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks to your kind guardianship, very well,” said
Britomarte, cordially.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are staring at that basket, Judith,” said Justin,
laughing. “Well, I have been to the ship, and brought
off some provisions for breakfast. The greater part of the
ship’s stores are spoiled by the wetting they got in the
storm; but still there is a considerable quantity, which,
from its position, escaped injury.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The breakfast was very leisurely eaten. It was a pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to linger over that <em>tête-à-tête</em> meal; and it was prolonged
as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it was over, Britomarte and Justin withdrew
from it, leaving Judith to her undisputed privilege of
washing up the service.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The first thing to be done,” said Justin, as they walked
apart, “is to provide shelter. There is no time to be lost
before it is done. The grotto, it is true, is better than the
open sky, and it is well enough at night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This grotto was at the inland base of that long mountain
that Justin crossed in coming from the causeway to
the center of the island. It was entered by a hole about
seven feet high by three broad. Around this hole, and up
the entire side of the mountain, the whole surface was
richly clothed with a thicket of shrubs and saplings
wherever they could find root hold in the soil between the
rocks, and it presented a most beautiful appearance. In
front of the grotto was the small natural opening in the
woods, where our little party had made their fire and
eaten their breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passing in through this hole of the rock, or doorway
of the grotto, as it might be called, Justin and Britomarte
found themselves in a spacious cave, of oval form and
great natural beauty. The floor was nearly level, and
the walls rose in the form of a dome, in the top of which
was a fissure that let in the sun; and floor and walls were
all of the most brilliant white stone, that reflected back
the sunlight with the lustre of frosted silver. The whole
size of the place was about that of a large family drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a palace for a fairy!—a bower for a queen!” said
Justin, in admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then they turned and left the grotto to look after
Judith.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='c005'>SAVING THE STORES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“The next thing to do,” said Justin, as they joined
Judith at the fire, “is to get all the stores from the wreck.
After I have secured them I may bring away as much of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>everything else that may be useful to us as I can move
before the ship breaks up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a great labor that you propose for yourself,” said
Britomarte, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An absolutely necessary labor, and therefore to be
undertaken and accomplished,” replied Justin, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must let us take our share of the work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear—sister, I mean—the task will be much too
laborious for you. The causeway over which all these
things have to be brought is no macadamized avenue, I
assure you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For all that, Justin, you traversed it; and you know
that I must make the attempt. If I fail, I will very quietly
yield the point and leave all the labor to yourself alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, well,” said Justin, laughing. “You are ‘queen
o’er yourself,’ and all things else here. You must work
your own will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And sure, here’s meself, wid me two hands to the fore,
ready to fetch and carry wid the best iv yez!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Judith, I had certainly counted on your
help,” said Mr. Rosenthal. “And now—sister—shall we
set forth?” he inquired, turning toward Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you please,” said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin looked up through the trees toward the blazing
sky. For though this was January, yet they were in a
climate where that month answers to our July.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is very hot and growing hotter; and I dare say you
did not bring a bonnet with you when you landed on this
island?” he inquired, with a droll look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dare say I did not,” smiled Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Judith took up the matter in grand gravity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bonnet?” she echoed. “Sure mine was lost itself in a
fray fight wid the say!—Bonnet? Faix, it was all I could
do at all, at all, to kape the hair itself on me head, let
alone bonnets!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we must improvise some defense for your heads
against this sun,” said Mr. Rosenthal, looking around.
“Ah! I have it! the palm leaves! nothing could be better!”
he exclaimed, starting off in a run through the
thicket toward the grove of cocoa palms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! sure, what would we do without him, at all, at all!
Troth, we hadn’t aven a dacent meal’s victuals till he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>come to our relaif, so we hadn’t. Sure, we’d perish intirely
only for him,” said Judith, looking gratefully in the
direction where Justin had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man-hater did not reply. There was no controverting
Judith’s words. Perhaps also they expressed
Britomarte’s own thoughts. What, indeed, though one
was brave and the other strong, could these two women
have done for self-preservation, left alone on this desert
island, without the help of the one man Providence had
sent to their assistance?</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin soon returned, bearing large palm leaves, which,
with some natural dexterity, he doubled and shaped into a
rude sort of hoods, more remarkable for utility than for
beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There,” he said; “they are not in the latest Parisian
style of ladies’ bonnets, I am afraid, but they will keep the
sun off, and to do that is the purpose for which they were
formed. I hope we may all answer the end of our creation
as well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were about to start, the little dog, seeing
symptoms of a move, began jumping and frisking around
them, to testify his approbation of the journey and his
willingness to share it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you don’t, my fine little fellow. I have had
enough of crossing the causeway with you. I had rather
carry a two-year-old child at once. We’ll leave you here,”
said Justin, looking about for some means of confining
the dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>To “leave him” there was easier to say than to do.
They might have tied him to a tree, only they had neither
rope nor chain. Or they might have shut him up in the
grotto, only they had no door to close against his exit.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length a bright idea struck Justin. He took his
handkerchief from his pocket, rubbed it well upon his
own face and hands and laid it down on the ground, and
called the little dog, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fidelle! Fidelle!—watch it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the loyal little creature ran and put his forepaws
upon it and stood looking “faithful unto death” with all
his might.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come—we can go now,” said Justin. “Our way leads
up the mountain, immediately over the roof of your grotto,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>sister; and the ascent is steep and rugged; and although
you are not a very ancient lady, I think that you will find
this staff serviceable; indeed, indispensible,” he added,
handing to Miss Conyers a stick that he had cut for her
use in climbing, and which she received with a smile of
thanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>He gave Judith a similar staff, and then they all set
forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>They ascended the mountain in a much shorter time
than might have been expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they reached the tableland on the summit, Justin
found a fragment of rock that would do for a seat, and
advised Britomarte to sit down and rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he took out his telescope and adjusted it, and invited
her to take a survey of their little kingdom—“For
this island is our kingdom, my sister!—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘We are monarchs of all we survey—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Our rights there is none to dispute;</div>
      <div class='line'>From the center all round to the sea</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We are lords of the bird and the brute.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“But how much happier we are than was poor, solitary
Robinson Crusoe, or his prototype, old Alexander Selkirk!”
said Justin, placing the telescope in her hands, as
she arose and stood beside him. “Rest the glass upon
my shoulder to steady it, and then look,” he added, placing
himself in a convenient position as a telescope-stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>She adjusted the instrument according to his advice,
pointing it toward the wreck, which she saw distinctly
wedged in the cleft of the rock at the end of the causeway.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor ship! I lament her fate almost as if she were a
human being doomed to death. For, of course, she is
doomed. She must break up sooner or later,” said Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sooner or later,” replied Justin, contemplatively;
“and it seems even the greater pity, because, as she lays
now, she is really not injured beyond repair, were the
means of repairing her at hand. However, she will hold
together the longer for being hurt no worse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte now lifted the end of the telescope from
Justin’s shoulder, and, taking it in both her own hands,
supported it thus while she made a survey of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>circle of the horizon. Some minutes passed in this review,
during which no one spoke. Britomarte was the
first to break silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A wilderness surrounded by the sea; a desert in the
midst of the ocean! It is magnificent—it is sublime in its
utter isolation and perfect solitude!” she said, lowering
her glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is,” answered Justin, relieving her of the telescope.
“Yet let Providence give me the time, strength, and opportunity
and this wilderness shall bloom and blossom as
the rose, this desert become a beautiful home. This
island shall be a new Eden, of which we shall be the new
Adam and Eve. Yes! for all that has come and gone, we
shall be very happy here—Sister!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He brought himself up with a jerk by this last word.
His fancy had been running away with him, until he saw
the clouds gathering upon the man-hater’s brow, when he
suddenly pulled up with—“Sister!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall we go on?” asked Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, if you are rested,” replied Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>And they resumed their journey, going down the
mountain side toward the causeway.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think that we had all the necessaries and comforts,
and many of the luxuries and elegancies of life on board
of our ship, had we not?” inquired Justin as they went
on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course; but you have some reason for asking
that question, or rather for reminding me of those
things. Now, what is your reason?” inquired Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merely to follow up your answer by assuring you that
you shall have all those necessaries, comforts, and perhaps
luxuries and elegancies still.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte looked up at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nearly all these things remain yet upon the wreck. If
it will only hold together for a month, I can, by diligence,
convey them all to the land, and store them here. There
is a chest of carpenter’s tools in the forecastle; and there
are building materials enough on the island. I can build
you a very fair little house, and furnish it comfortably
with the furniture I shall rescue from the cabin and staterooms
of the wreck. There is also a large assortment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>grain and garden seeds, which poor Ely was carrying out
with him to try the experiment of growing them on
Indian soil. I will try the more promising experiment of
planting them on your island. And then there are the
animals to stock your farm! The cow, the pigs, the sheep,
and the poultry—if I can only get them over the causeway.
This—the removal of the animals—will certainly
be the most difficult part of our enterprise. But if it is
to be effected by any amount of labor and perseverence, I
will effect it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, sir, did ye say as Cuddie is saved, the crayture?”
inquired Judith, who was tugging on after them as fast as
she could.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cuddie!” echoed Mr. Rosenthal, with an air of perplexity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir, sure—Cuddie, the captain’s cow itself, the
crayture! I was asking you, is she saved, sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes,” laughed Justin; “I milked her this morning
for your breakfast, you know, Judith. And oh! by the
way, I fed your cat and kittens, too, Judith. They, also,
are quite safe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, thin, bad luck to thim! Are they safe itself, afther
bringing their betthers to ruin sure! Faix! I wish they’d
been drowned, so I do, the day I brought them on the ship
to bring destruction on us all! Ah, bedad! we’ll lave them
where they are, and not bring a bit of them off at all, at
all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that would be cruel, Judith. And as for myself, I
shall not leave the smallest living creature to perish on
the ship, if any effort of mine will save it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, thin, sure would ye bring thim divil’s imps on the
land to bring us to disthruction over agin!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“People can’t be brought to destruction ‘over again,’
my good girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, can’t they though, nather! Sure ourselves was
brought to disthruction once be the shipwrack, and we
may be brought to disthruction over again be wild
bastes or ilse be cannibals! Whist! Lord kape us!
where are yez a-going to at all, at all?” gasped Judith,
breaking off suddenly in her discourse, and stopping short
in her progress upon the brink of one of those chasms
that cut the causeway across.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Don’t be frightened, Judith. Stand just where you
are until I help Miss Conyers over to the other side, and
then I will come back for you,” said Justin, who was
carefully supporting Britomarte in her difficult descent
down one side of the steep.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he had lifted her across the stream at the bottom,
and helped her to climb the other side, and seen her safe
upon the top, he returned to fetch Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Troth, I’ve heard tell iv the divil’s highway, but niver
saw it before; and sure this must be itself!” said Judith,
as she gave her hand to Mr. Rosenthal, and clambered
awkwardly down the descent.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he had convoyed Judith safely to the other side
of the chasm they all three resumed their walk. Several
of these chasms they crossed in the same manner. And
finally they reached the ship, which remained in the state
in which Justin had left it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Rosenthal handed Miss Conyers on deck, and then
helped Judith up beside her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte looked around with sorrowful reminiscences
of that dire calamity which had separated her from all her
late companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never expected to tread these planks again! It
seems strange to be here! It seems almost wrong to be
here! as if we had no right to be alive, now that all our
fellow-voyagers are lost! I cannot rejoice in being saved,
remembering their destruction!” she murmured, sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We do not know that they have been destroyed. I
think it highly probable that the boat which first left the
ship’s side—the boat containing the missionary party—was
saved,” said Justin, with the purpose of consoling
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you think so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because it was the most seaworthy boat of the two,
and it was manned by a more knowing crew, and finally,
because they had sense enough to sail for the open sea instead
of making for that fatal rock-bound coast upon
which your boat was wrecked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Heaven grant they may have been saved!” fervently
exclaimed Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, the poor ould ship! Oh, me poor ould daddy!
Oh, me darlint Fore Top Tom! Are yez all lost intirely?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Drowned in the dape say? Oh, me fine ship! Oh, me
good daddy! Oh, me gay Tom! Ow-oo! Ow-oo!
Ow-oo!” cried Judith, sitting down upon the deck, flinging
her apron over her head, rocking herself to and fro,
and howling dismally.</p>

<p class='c007'>And as she was howling, not only from an acute feeling
of grief, but also from a profound sense of propriety,
there was not the least use of any one’s attempting to console
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte laid her hand gently upon the woman’s
head, and kept it there a moment as a tacit assurance of
sympathy, and then passed on.</p>

<p class='c007'>To get into the cabin she was obliged first to climb up
the leaning deck, and then go round to the companion
ladder and climb down.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin helped her as much as she would allow him to
do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking around upon the empty cabin and the vacant
staterooms, lately the home of herself and her fellow-voyagers,
she was almost overwhelmed by the realization
of the awful calamity that had befallen them.</p>

<p class='c007'>She wondered why it was that she could not weep! but
she really could not! the feeling of awe overpowered the
feeling of grief, and, besides, the pressure of necessity
was upon her—the necessity of immediate action.</p>

<p class='c007'>She went into the stateroom and changed all her clothing,
and from her good stock of wearing apparel, which
she found in excellent preservation, she selected two more
changes; then she took her sewing materials—needles,
thread, scissors and thimble, and her little toilet service—combs,
brushes, soap and towels, and she rolled all these
articles up together in a compact little parcel, and tied it
up with pocket handkerchiefs. And while doing this, she
experienced a feeling of compunction for taking off anything
for her own individual comfort only, when so much
needed to be carried off for the general good. But then,
again, she reflected that the common decencies of life, no
less than her own inclination, made it absolutely necessary
that she should provide herself with the means of personal
neatness and cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the time she had made up her little parcel, Judith,
who had finished her performance on deck, and so satisfied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>her sense of what was expected from her, came stumbling
down the companion ladder.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Judith’s cat and kittens, recognizing their mistress,
jumped out of the spare stateroom and ran up to her,
purring and lifting their little tails, and rubbing their
sides against her feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Judith made short work with them all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, thin, get out iv me way, ye divil’s bastes. Sure,
if it wasn’t bad luck to kill cats, I’d haive the whole iv
yez into the say, so I would!” she cried, lifting them one
by one upon her foot, and tossing them away as fast and
as far as she could.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then she went in turn to all the staterooms except
Britomarte’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, I suppose I may help meself to everything that
you doesn’t want here? For, sure, what you won’t take
lies betwane meself and the say. And if meself don’t take
it, the say will. And the rightful owners will niver want
it at all, at all! Say, ma’am!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judith,” said Miss Conyers, doubtfully, “if I understand
what you mean by so many ‘selfs,’ you are asking
my leave to take what you want from this cabin?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, yes, ma’am, that’s just what I mane itself!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I have no right either to give or withhold leave.
Here we have equal privileges, and you must do as you
please; or, rather, you must act according to the dictates
of your own conscience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, ma’am, I know betther than that intirely. Sure,
I’m not going to act according to the dictates iv what’s-its-name,
nor anything else, at all, at all. I’m going to
do as ye bid me. Faix, meself knows we are both depinding
on the gintleman to save us from perishing intirely.
And, troth, ye can wind the gintleman around yer
finger, so ye can; and so, bedad, it behooves me to do as
ye say, since he’s king and you’re quane.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So,” thought the man-hater to herself, “what power I
possess in virtue of superior intellect and education goes
for nothing with this, my only female companion; but
what power I possess, through my interest with this one
able-bodied male creature, is all in all, because, forsooth,
we are both dependent upon him (with his physical superiority)
to save us from perishing. Why, the physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>superiority is a quality he possesses in common with the
ox and the ass! Yes; but the ox and the ass have not
physical superiority united to intellectual power as he has.
A drove of oxen or asses could not save us, as this one
man can! Bah! nature has been very unjust to women,
and that is the sacred truth! She should have given us
strong bodies to match our strong hearts and heads!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And ye have niver tould me whether or no I may take
what I like,” said Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I tell you now: Judith, help yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanky, ma’am! Sure, it’s a privilege I nivir had before
in all me life; but, thanks to the shipwrack, I have
it now! Sure, it’s an ill wind that blows nobody good,”
said Judith, going into Mrs. Ely’s room and beginning to
rummage over that poor woman’s finery with great satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mary Ely, having been the daughter of a wealthy merchant,
had as large and as rich a stock of wearing apparel
as any woman in the middle class of life could wish to
possess; and Judith overhauled it with great enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, what an illigant shawl!” she cried, holding up a
fine, large camel’s-hair wrap. “What an illigant shawl
entirely to wear to mass! What would Fore Top Tom
think iv me in this? And, sure, won’t it astonish them
all whin I wear it! Father O’Neil may talk as much as
he likes about the lilies of the field and Solomon in all
his glory; but, sure, I’ll wear this shawl to mass if I have
to make up for it wid a thousand ‘Hail Marys.’ But,
sure, there’s no mass nor no church on that baste iv an
island, and I should only wear it for them wild bastes
to grin at. But, ah, what a darlint iv a green silk dhress,
and how beautiful it will go with the shawl, sure! Look,
ma’am!” she exclaimed, rushing up to Miss Conyers,
and holding up the shawl in one hand and the dress in the
other for inspection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte turned away, revolted at the woman’s exhibition
of thoughtlessness or heartlessness. If one of the
common enemy had acted as Judith did in this matter,
Britomarte would have poured upon him the full measure
of her scorn and indignation; but with her own sex she
was ever most merciful and forbearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, ma’am—oh, look! the beautiful red shawl and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the green silk dhress. Sure, ye niver set eyes on ’em before!
She’d niver be wearing the like iv these on the
deck, to be spoilt intirely wid the salt say wather. Look,
ma’am,” persisted Judith, too much absorbed in her own
delight to observe the pained expression of Miss Conyers’
countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Judith! how can you! Don’t—don’t!” was all
that she could reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was enough; for in an instant the consciousness
of her own seeming want of heart flashed upon Judith’s
mind and quite overwhelmed her with remorse. She
dropped the finery, flung herself down upon the floor in a
sitting position, threw her apron over her head, and began
to rock her body to and fro, crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, the baste that I was! Oh, the haythen I made iv
meself! Oh, the divil I was turning into wid me vanity
and hardness iv heart! To be enjoying ov the property
before iver graving for the dead! Oh, the poor young
craythur, cut off in the bloom iv her youth! Sure, she
was the core iv me heart and the light iv me eye! But I
shall niver see her again—niver! She’s gone! gone!
gone!—lost in the salt say wather! Ow-oo! ow-oo!
ow! Och-hone! och-hone! och-hone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Judith set in for a regular bout of rocking and
howling—not by any means in the spirit of hypocrisy, but
as a matter of business, from a sense of duty, and with a
feeling of some little sorrow which she was conscientiously
trying to increase.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers liked this performance quite as little as
she had the other; but, as she was not a habitual fault-finder,
she said nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, on deck Justin had collected together as
many stores as the united strength of himself and party
could carry to the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now he came down the companion ladder, and inquired:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you ready to return, sister?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite,” answered Miss Conyers. Then turning to her
companion, she said: “Come, Judith, my good girl, compose
yourself, and make your bundle. We have got
to go on shore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the gintleman ready?” inquired Judith, dropping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>her apron from her head and revealing a red, swollen,
tear-stained face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Judith, and waiting. Let me help you up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thankey, ma’am! Sure, I wouldn’t throuble ye, only
me limbs bend under me wid the graif I’m failing for the
poor young crayture who has left me her clothes!” said
Judith, trying hard to feel as badly as she said she did.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, she was very particular in making up her
bundle of finery, which was so large that she could afford
Mr. Rosenthal but little assistance in conveying a part of
the stores that he had gathered together. But at length
she managed to tie her bundle on her back and take a box
of tea on her head. And so she followed Mr. Rosenthal
and Miss Conyers, who were both laden with as much as
they could carry.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII.<br> <span class='c005'>MYSTERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We must leave our three shipwrecked voyagers on the
desert island, and return on the wings of thought to look
after their friends left behind at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the missionary ship had been sailing toward the
sun and toward the reef, our ship of state, our beloved
nation, was also sailing toward the sun and toward the
reef—toward the glorious sun of emancipation, toward
the fatal reef of disunion. I shall not burden this light
and simple story with the politics of the Civil War. I
shall only allude to it where it immediately concerns the
people of whom I am writing.</p>

<p class='c007'>When, in October, the missionary ship sailed from the
United States disunion was not dreamed of, except by a
few leading politicians. But after the election of Mr. Lincoln,
in November, and before any overt act of secession
took place, it is now well known that secret meetings were
held in Washington, Richmond, Annapolis, and all the
principal cities in the border States, to take measures to
prepare the people of those States to act promptly and in
concert when the opportunity for seceding should present
itself. But the foremost object of this conspiracy was to
muster into Maryland and Virginia a secret military force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>strong enough to seize and occupy Washington, and prevent
the President-elect from taking his seat there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the most active, secretive, and persevering of
these conspirators was the accomplished scholar, soldier,
and statesman whom I have introduced to you, my readers,
under the name of Colonel Eastworth.</p>

<p class='c007'>You know already that during the greater part of the
summer of that year he was in Washington, ostensibly on
a visit to his father’s friend and his own old tutor, the
retired Lutheran minister. In September he left the city
to return to his home in the South. In October he reappeared
in Washington, and took rooms in one of the
best hotels most frequented by Southern gentlemen. But
while he made Washington his headquarters, he went on
frequent journeys to Charleston, Richmond, Annapolis,
and other cities. And not even to his betrothed did he
ever mention the object of these sudden journeys.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was his manner of life until the first of December,
when, as usual at the meeting of Congress, the city
became crowded with visitors. All the boarding-houses
and hotels were full of people, and very full of discomfort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth, a constitutional sybarite and epicurean,
escaped as often as he could from the crowded
rooms and scuffling meals of his “best hotel” to the quiet
fireside and dainty table of the Lutheran minister’s home.
Colonel Eastworth was certainly no petulant fault-finder;
yet in his close intimacy with the family of his betrothed,
he sometimes let fall half-laughing expressions that betrayed
how ludicrously uncomfortable he was when in
his quarters at the “best hotel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rosenthal, in his earnest German nature, considered
betrothal almost as sacred as marriage, and looked upon
the betrothed lover of his daughter as already his own son.
And so, one day, when they chanced to meet in the Capitol
library, and the colonel was unusually sarcastic on the
subject of hotel living, the minister said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, see here, Eastworth. We have a very large
house, with four rooms on a floor, and sixteen rooms in
all, counting basement and attics, and only myself and
my daughter and our two servants to occupy them.
Now, as you are to pass the whole winter in Washington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>what should hinder you from coming and stopping
with us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks! Really, you are very kind; but—circumstantial
evidence to the contrary notwithstanding—I did
not mean to angle for and draw out this invitation,”
laughed the colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t I know that you didn’t? But you will come?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be too great a trespass on your kindness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense! not at all! You are one of us! You are
my son. And really, now, Eastworth, I want you to
come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A thousand thanks! I shall be too glad to do so! I
accept your kindness as frankly as it is offered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is right. And now I will go home and tell Erminie
to have fires lighted in your rooms, to air them
comfortably for you against your arrival. She will be
glad, I know. But—when shall we expect you? This
evening, shall it not be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth hesitated, smiled, and then replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This evening? Yes, if you please, if it will be convenient
for you. There is really no reason on my part
for delay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor on mine! nor on Erminie’s! nor on the servants’;
I do not wish to boast of our housekeeping, Eastworth,
but I take pleasure in telling you that we are always prepared
to receive our friends. And if to-night we should
be surprised by the sudden inroad of a tribe of cousins as
numerous as a Scotch clan, it could not put us out in the
least. There, now! come when you like! Come home
with me now, if you choose, and send a messenger to the
hotel to direct your servants to pack up your property
and follow you!” said the minister, cordially.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Many thanks! but I must return to my room first. I
will join you at your tea table.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well! Then I will expect you,” said the minister,
as cordially as if he himself had received a favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>They parted for a few hours. Colonel Eastworth, for
many reasons deeply gratified with this project, returned
to his hotel to prepare for his removal to his new quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rosenthal, pleased with the thought of giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>pleasure to others, hastened home to inform his daughter
of the plan and to get ready for his guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie was delighted. It had come to this pass with
the minister’s gentle child—that she only seemed to live in
the presence of her lover; and to have him always under
the same roof with herself seemed to be the perfection of
happiness. She could ask no more than that of earth or
heaven. And what comfort she took in preparing for his
arrival! Colonel Eastworth, like most middle-aged gentlemen
of a certain class, was an epicure, and his betrothed
bride knew it. First, she went to the kitchen and
gave the cook very particular directions concerning the
preparation of certain dainty dishes sure to delight the
fastidious palate of the expected guest. Then she called
the housemaid, and went to get the spare rooms ready for
his accommodation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rosenthal’s house was a large, square, brick building,
standing in its own grounds, which, even in winter,
looked very bright and cheerful with its many evergreens.
There were long, vine-shaded porches before every floor
in front of the house, which was of three stories, with
basement and attic. There was a large hall running from
front to back through the center of each floor, and having
two rooms on each side. The basement contained the
kitchen, laundry, servants’ room, and cellar. The first
floor contained, on the right hand of the broad entrance
hall, the long drawing-rooms, connected or divided at will
by sliding doors; and on the left hand, the family library
in front, and the dining-room back.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second floor contained, on the right of the hall, the
minister’s private apartments, consisting of a bedchamber
and a study, and on the left, Erminie’s bedroom and private
sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third story comprised two suites of spare rooms,
neatly furnished and well kept, for the accommodation of
visitors.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this third floor, Erminie, attended by her handmaid,
repaired. She opened the front windows of the left suite
of rooms, letting in a flood of sunlight to the beautiful
parlor, while her attendant knelt down before the grate
and began to light the fire, which was always kept ready
for kindling. Everything was in such exquisite order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>that there was but little else to be done than to warm and
air the rooms. But when the fire was burning brightly,
Erminie drew the sofa up one side of the hearth, and the
easy-chair up on the other, and placed a footstool and a
sofa-stand before each. Then she went down into the
library, and brought up the magazines of the month and
the papers of the day, and placed them on the center-table.
And, finally, she went to the conservatory and
gathered a few choice winter roses and geraniums and
placed them in a grass-green Bohemian vase, and brought
it and set it on the mantelpiece, where the fragrance of
the flowers filled the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, leaving the handmaid to prepare the adjoining
bedchamber, she went down to put a few graceful finishing
touches to the arrangements of the drawing-rooms,
library, and dining parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next to the delight of a mother preparing for the visit
of her son is the delight of a girl preparing for the comfort
of her betrothed lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie shared her father’s religious belief in the sacredness
and inviolability of betrothal; and she seemed to
herself little less than a wife, making ready for the reception
of her husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>She ordered the tea table to be set in the library; and
never was a tea table more exquisitely neat and dainty in
all its arrangements than this which was prepared under
the immediate supervision of the minister’s daughter. She
knew that the library was the favorite room with their
visitor as well as with her father and herself. And never
before did it look more inviting than on this evening when
it was made ready to receive their most welcome guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Erminie had seen these arrangements completed,
she contemplated the effect with a smile of satisfaction,
and then went to make her own toilet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth came in good time. Erminie’s quick
ears were the first to catch the sound of the carriage
wheels as they turned into the gate and rolled up the
avenue toward the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rosenthal himself went out to receive the guest and
show him up to his rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie, who had been so very busy in preparing for
him, was now seized with a strange timidity, which prevented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>her from going forth to welcome him. But she
rang for the housemaid to show Colonel Eastworth’s
servant where to carry his master’s trunk, and then she
went back to the library and sat down to wait until her
father should return with her lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes they came downstairs and entered the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie half arose to receive her betrothed. She saw
his look of appreciation and approbation as he glanced
around the room before his eye fell upon herself, and he
advanced toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This looks like a little paradise, after the pandemonium
in which I have lately existed. A paradise, of which my
lady is the Peri,” he murmured, in a low voice, as he lifted
her hand, and, bowing over it, pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie blushed beautifully and murmured something
in reply, to the effect that she hoped he would be happy
with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph!” thought the good minister to himself—“that
is all very high-toned, I dare say; but, for my part,
I had rather seen him kiss her openly and heartily, as an
honest sweetheart and betrothed husband should! but,
then, very likely he is right and I am an old-fashioned
fogy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you ready for tea, papa, dear?” inquired Erminie,
with her hand upon the bell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, pet—quite; and so is Eastworth. Have it in
directly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie rang, and tea was immediately served. Everything
was in perfect neatness and taste. Colonel Eastworth’s
favorite delicacies were on the table. Erminie
presided over the urn. And the pretty parlor maid waited
on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A beautiful contrast to the hurly-burly of the hotel
ordinary!” said Eastworth, frankly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should not be too hard upon the hotels. How is it
possible they should be any better than they are, in their
present overcrowded state,” said the charitable minister.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then their conversation left the hotel grievance
and turned upon more agreeable subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>When tea was over and the service cleared away, Erminie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>brought out Gustave Doré’s illustration of “Don
Quixote,” and laid the volume on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a rare work and a new purchase; and it had
cost the good minister a round sum to import it from
Paris. But Erminie had expressed a wish to possess it;
and her father never denied his beloved daughter anything
that she wanted which it was possible for him to
procure. So here it lay upon the table; at this time, perhaps,
the only copy of the work to be found in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth had never seen it; so Erminie had
the delight of being the first to show it to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are perhaps about a hundred large plates—each
plate being a perfect work of art, to be studied separately
and carefully, and with ever-increasing appreciation and
enjoyment of its truthfulness to nature and richness in
humor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the examination of this book the hours sped quickly
away, so quickly that ten o’clock, the regular bedtime
of the quiet household, came and passed unheeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if the striking of the clock did not disturb our
laughing party, something else soon after did—the ringing
of the street doorbell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rosenthal himself went out to see what this very
late summons might mean.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the penny postman of his district. And the
minister started; for this was an unheard of hour for
the penny postman to present himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, doctor, it is I,” said the man, handing a letter to
the minister. “You see, it came by the late mail, and,
being a foreign letter, I thought it might be from your
son who went out to the Indies, and so I thought I
wouldn’t keep you waiting for it until the regular delivery
to-morrow morning, but I would just step around
with it to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A thousand thanks, my friend. It is from my son!
It is in his handwriting. A thousand thanks! this is a
real act of kindness, which I shall never cease to remember,”
said the minister, earnestly, as he received the letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t mention such a trifle, doctor. Good-night,
sir,” said the kind-hearted penny postman, taking himself
off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie, my dear, here is a letter from your brother!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>exclaimed the minister, bursting into the library with all
the vehemence of a schoolboy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” cried his daughter, jumping to meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>And for the time being Colonel Eastworth was “left
out in the cold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! pray excuse us, sir! Have we your permission?”
inquired the minister, suddenly recollecting himself
and bowing to his guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, certainly, certainly! Am I not one of yourselves?
Pray do not mind me,” replied Colonel Eastworth,
smiling, and then turning his whole attention to
Gustave Doré, which lay still before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rosenthal opened the letter; and then the father
and daughter held it between them, bent their heads over
it and read it together.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the first letter they had received from Justin—a
letter that he had written and mailed at Porto Praya.
It merely told them of the ship’s prosperous voyage and
safe arrival at Porto Praya, and of the well-being of all
the passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you have had good news from my friend Justin
and his party,” said Colonel Eastworth, as they joined
him at the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Excellent! They have had a very prosperous voyage
as far as Porto Praya, with every prospect of a continuance
of fine weather, thank Heaven! There, you can see
what he says, if you will take the trouble to look over his
letter,” said the minister, putting the paper into the visitor’s
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks,” said Colonel Eastworth, with a bow. Then
he drew Erminie to his side, so that she could look over
the letter again with him, and opened it, saying, with a
smile:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know, of course, that you cannot read this too
often.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe you read my thoughts,” answered Erminie,
with a beautiful flush. “And—I do wish I could read
yours as well,” she added, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you could, my dearest. You would know
then, for yourself, how perfectly I love you,” he replied,
in a low whisper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know that already. I never for a moment doubted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>your love. What, indeed, but perfect love could draw
you down to me?” murmured Erminie, in a voice tremulous
with emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God bless you in your faith, my dearest! But why,
then, do you wish to read my thoughts?” inquired Colonel
Eastworth, with a sidelong glance toward the minister,
to see if he was attending to their conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>But no—Dr. Rosenthal was deep in the study of Gustave
Doré.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you wish to read my thoughts, Erminie?”
repeated her lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I do not know. Sometimes when you have been
here spending an evening alone with me, you have been
so moody, so grave, so thoughtful, so absent-minded, so
utterly oblivious of all around you; so utterly oblivious
even of me,” replied Erminie, sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of you! Never, Erminie. Never, for an instant,
better angel of my life!” exclaimed Eastworth, warmly,
though still in a suppressed voice. Then he paused and
reflected for a few moments, and then he said: “Sweet
girl, I am no longer a young man, and middle age brings
with it trials and responsibilities with which I do not
wish to burden your gentle heart. No, Erminie, I am
no longer a young man. I remember sometimes with
pain, and with grave misgivings—ay, almost with despair—that
I am your senior for full twenty years!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, why do you say that? I never knew and never
asked myself whether you were thirty, or forty, or fifty!
But I do know that I—I——” She broke down in the
sweet confession she was trying to make, and dropped
her head and hid her face upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>He encircled her waist with his arm, and stooped to
whisper something.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Rosenthal glanced up over the tops of his spectacles,
muttering to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! so that is the way in which they read my
son’s letter;” and then he bent his head still lower over
Gustave Doré, and became still more absorbed in study.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you do not love me the less because, like
Othello, I am somewhat ‘declined into the vale of
years’?” Eastworth asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke so low as scarcely to break the dead silence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of the room—a silence which was so profound, that when
the mantel clock began to strike it sounded like an alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eleven o’clock! Bless my soul! Erminie, ring for
the bedroom candles!” exclaimed the doctor, rousing
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie obeyed. The housemaid appeared with three
wax candles in three little silver candlesticks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have no gas in the bedrooms. I consider it unhealthy.
Good-night,” said the doctor, as he lighted a
candle and handed it to his guest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='c005'>ERMINIE’S TRIALS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On the morning succeeding the domestication of Colonel
Eastworth in the family, Erminie, restless with excess
of happiness, arose earlier than usual.</p>

<p class='c007'>She went down into the library to open and air it, and
to have the fire lighted and the table set for breakfast under
her own supervision.</p>

<p class='c007'>And half an hour later, when Dr. Rosenthal and Colonel
Eastworth entered the room, a very pleasant scene
greeted them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morning sun was shining brightly in, lighting up
the amber-colored hangings, the gilded picture frames,
the glass bookcases, and the silver service of the breakfast
table. The fire burned clearly in the polished grate,
and by its side sat Erminie in her soft white merino
morning dress and rich auburn ringlets.</p>

<p class='c007'>She arose with a smile to greet her father and her
lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her father kissed her fondly and then took up a morning
paper and appeared to become absorbed in its contents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her lover drew her away to the sunny window and
whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dearest, I recognized your loving care in every
single arrangement for my comfort in my rooms last
night. I knew it was this dear hand that wheeled my
sofa in its place, and set the footstool, and even cut the
leaves of the magazines upon the table. Shall I thank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>you for all this? No, sweet girl, I will not mock you
so. But do you know, Erminie, that I sat up last night
turning over all those magazines, merely because these
dear fingers had touched them all?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am so glad that you can be pleased with anything
I can do for you, for, oh, it is so little I can do,” she
murmured, softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can love me! You do love me, and that love of
yours makes your slightest act for me a priceless service!”
he replied, fervently pressing her hand to his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hallo, Eastworth! what’s this? what’s this? what’s
this? What on earth are they about in the Senate?”
suddenly cried out the old minister, staring at the paper
in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is what, sir?” inquired Colonel Eastworth, leaving
the side of Erminie and going to join her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This! this!” said the old minister, pointing emphatically
to a lengthened report of the previous day’s debate
in the Senate. It was a warm debate between the Union
and the Secession factions. Eastworth looked from the
paper to the face of the reader, and his face grew dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid, sir,” he said, “that you do not look into
the papers very often to keep up with the politics of the
day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no—I do not; I never did and never shall. I
always let the opposing parties fight out their own battles,
having such firm faith in the glorious destinies of
the country as to feel well assured that the very worst of
them can never succeed in bringing it to ruin. My eyes
only happened to fall upon this debate by chance. But,
I say, this looks a little serious, doesn’t it—as if they
really mean secession, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think the Southern States really mean it, sir,” said
Eastworth, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old minister reflected a moment, and then laughed,
and threw the paper aside, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pooh! pooh! Eastworth! Nonsense! A few crafty
and unscrupulous politicians, who are willing to sacrifice
their country so that they may rise into transient notoriety
upon its ruins, may rant as they please, and a few hotheaded
boys, who are ready for revolution or excitement
of any sort, at any price, may be led astray by their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>sophistries. But the Southern people at large, with their
whole-hearted attachment to and pride in their country—never,
Eastworth, never; it is all talk, all dream, all
moonshine! Nonsense! Erminie, ring for the breakfast,
my dear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old Lutheran minister was no politician; he was a
philosopher and bookworm; but he was not alone in his
incredulity. Even up to this late period, it was very
difficult to make any sane man, not infected with the
madness of the day, believe in the possibility of disunion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Breakfast was served. But for some reason or other,
the social morning meal did not pass off so cheerfully as
it might have been expected to do. And as soon as it
was over, Colonel Eastworth excused himself and went
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth came home to the late dinner. He
was grave, absorbed, absent-minded. He sometimes
shook off this pre-occupation, but it was with an evident
effort. There was no danger that he should talk politics
with his host; he was very, very reticent on all public
subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dinner they withdrew to the drawing-room,
where coffee was served, and then Dr. Rosenthal took
his pipe and went off to his study to smoke and read.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie was left alone with her betrothed. A sort of
shyness, that she never could get rid of, when left <em>tête-à-tête</em>
with her lover, induced her to rise and open the
piano. She sang and played, one after another, his favorite
songs, and in many of them he joined his voice
to hers. At length she struck into the old, yet ever new,
beloved and all-inspiring “Star-Spangled Banner.” She
had sung the first stanza, and was striking into the chorus
with all her heart and soul, expecting him to join
her with all the ardor and enthusiasm of his Southern
nature, when suddenly he laid his hand upon her shoulder—his
hand, that shook as with palsy:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not that! not that! Oh, my dearest—not that, if
you love me!” he exclaimed, in a voice that shook as
much as did his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>She ceased playing, and turned around and looked at
him in meek surprise. She had never before in all her
acquaintance seen him moved from his gentlemanly self-possession;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>but now he was terribly shaken. She was
alarmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why? Why may I not sing the ‘Star-Spangled
Banner’?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot bear it! My dearest, I cannot! Strong man
that I thought myself, I cannot!” he exclaimed, with the
same half-suppressed, tempestuous emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, why? Tell me why?” she persisted, with affectionate
earnestness. “You have fought gallantly for it;
you have shed your priceless blood in its defense; you
have won immortal fame under it. Oh, why, then, may
I not sing the praises of that glorious banner, so doubly
dear to me for your sake?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was frightfully agitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, hush, Erminie, hush!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! what has disturbed you so—what?” she exclaimed,
rising from the piano and standing by his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some day, better angel of my life, I will tell you all.
Not now! I cannot bear to do it; nor could you bear to
hear it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can bear all things—all things for your sake! Try
me—try me! Say, is your trouble now connected with
the dear old flag?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is connected with——” He paused, and then,
with a spasmodic effort, added—“the dear old flag! But
enough! ‘Old things shall pass away, and all things
shall become new!’ We shall raise a banner, Erminie,
in the blaze of whose young glory the old stars and
stripes shall pale and fade, as the stars of night at the
rising of the sun!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, what do you mean? What are you about to do?”
gasped Erminie, in a low voice, as she turned deadly
pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, till
you approve the deed!’” he answered, smiling and throwing
off the gloom that had gathered around them.</p>

<p class='c007'>And in good time he did so; for the door opened
quietly, and the old doctor, who had finished his pipe,
sauntered into the room, to spend the rest of the evening
with his children, as he called these two.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many more evenings did the betrothed lovers spend
alone in that drawing-room. But not again did Erminie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>attempt to sing the “Star-Spangled Banner;” and not
again did Colonel Eastworth lose his self-possession, or
hint darking at the “coming events” that cast their
shadows over his spirit. As the scene of that evening
was not repeated, Erminie let its memory fade from her
mind, and she grew tranquil and happy in the society of
her lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Colonel Eastworth was neither happy, nor even
tranquil. An honorable gentleman, a patriotic citizen, and
a distinguished soldier, who had won ever-living laurels
in the service of his country, and now a State’s Rights
man, conscientiously plotting her ruin, his mind was torn
by the struggles of what he called a “divided duty,” and
likened not unaptly to the martyrdom of dismemberment
by wild horses. Nor did the society of his betrothed bride
tend to soothe him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was too madly in love with the minister’s beautiful
child to bear the close intimacy of her constant companionship
with anything like calmness—unless he could be
permitted to marry her immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening they were as usual alone in the drawing-room.
She was seated at the piano, singing his favorite
song. He was bending over her, turning the music, but
thinking far more of her than of anything else. She was
singing the refrain of that song so full of wild, sad, almost
despairing aspiration:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Beloved eye! beloved star!</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art so near, and yet—so far!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He bent lower over her, until his quick breath stirred
her bright auburn ringlets. As she ceased singing, he
whispered, in a voice vibrating with intense feeling:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Beloved star!’ Thou art so near, and yet—so far!
Oh, my dearest! Oh, Erminie! do you know—do you
know what my trial is! To be with you every hour of the
day, your betrothed husband, sharing the same home, sitting
at the same fireside, mocked with the appearance of
the closest intimacy, yet kept at the sternest distance!
Oh, Erminie! I cannot bear it longer, love! The period
of my probation must—it must be shortened! Say, love!
shall I speak to your father once more? Shall I implore
him to fix an early day for our union?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The color deepened on Erminie’s cheek; and she hesitated
a few moments before she replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are very happy now! we are together almost all
the time. What more can we require? My dear father is
very much opposed to our marriage taking place before
two years. And why should we hurry him? Surely,
surely you do not dream that in these two years I shall
change toward you?” she suddenly inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my angel, no! I dream nothing of you but to
your honor! I know that you are truth itself! But I cannot
wait two years to call you mine, my love! I must—I
must have your consent to speak to your father and implore
him to shorten the time of our betrothal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was very happy,” said Erminie, thoughtfully, “but I
cannot be so any longer if you are discontented, for your
discontent would be mine. Speak to my dear father, if
you will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, dearest, thanks! I will lose no time,” he said,
and he pressed her to his bosom for a moment, and then
hurried out of the room to look for Dr. Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found the Lutheran minister in his study, sitting
in his easy-chair, enjoying his pipe, and enveloped in a
cloud of aromatic smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! is it you, Eastworth? Sit down; take out your
pipe—I know you carry it about you—and try some of
this tobacco; it is prime,” said the doctor, cordially, pushing
another easy-chair toward his guest, and setting his
box of tobacco near to his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks,” said Eastworth, availing himself at once of
all his old friend’s invitations, as the quickest method of
conciliating him.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was silence for a moment, then Colonel Eastworth
said abruptly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir, I have come to speak to you about your daughter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old minister laid down his pipe and turned to the
speaker. The name of his daughter was powerful enough,
at any time, to bring him all the way back from the past
and fix his attention on the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; well, what of Erminie?” he inquired, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth reflected for a moment, and then
plunged headlong into the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would submit to you, sir, respectfully, but very earnestly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>that an engagement of two years will be intolerably
tedious to me. I come to entreat you to shorten the
period. There is really no reason why we should not be
married at once. I love your daughter devotedly, and I
am so blessed as to have won her affections. My means
are ample, and I shall be only too happy to make any settlements
upon my bride that you may please to name.
My character and position, I hope you know, are unimpeachable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All that is true, Eastworth—quite true!” said the old
doctor, taking up his pipe and putting it in his mouth, and
puffing away leisurely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, sir, let me hope that you will reconsider your
decision, and allow the marriage to take place soon,”
pleaded the colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Eastworth. She is much too young to be married
yet. Think of it!—she is not yet seventeen! Her
youth is an objection to her marriage that cannot be set
aside, Eastworth, by any agent except time. You must
be patient, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor could further pleading move the old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth rejoined Erminie in the drawing-room.
She looked up inquiringly as he entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your father is obdurate, my sweet love! I cannot
win his consent to my wishes, upon any terms,” he said,
with a profound sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we must be patient. My dear father is very
good to us in all other respects; in this also, perhaps,
though we do not know it,” replied Erminie, gently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may be so, love,” said Eastworth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you know that if our engagement were to last
ten years, or twenty, and if, in the meantime, you should
travel to the uttermost ends of the earth, and I should
never see or hear from you, I should still be true to you—yes!
true as truth!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it, my only love! And I shall soon put your
truth to a terrible test!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Put it to any test! to any!” exclaimed Erminie, rashly,
in her great faith.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='c005'>ANOTHER LOVE CHASE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On the morning succeeding the conversation related at
the close of the last chapter, Erminie was seated at work
in her own room, and singing as she sewed, when the
housemaid entered and laid a card before her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Vittorio Corsoni,’ our Italian professor! Where is
he, Catherine?” inquired Erminie, with her eyes on the bit
of enameled pasteboard that bore the name she read.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I showed him into the drawing-room, miss; which he
says he would very much like to see you for a few minutes,
if so be you can do him the honor,” replied the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, Catherine—our ex-master! I will go at
once,” said the minister’s daughter, rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>Always dressed with exquisite neatness, Erminie had
no occasion to keep her visitor waiting. She followed the
maid down the stairs, and passed into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young Italian professor was seated, leaning back
in one of the easy chairs. He looked haggard and careworn,
but quite as handsome and interesting as ever, with
his long, curling black hair, large, luminous, dark eyes,
and slight and elegant form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie walked straight toward him. She liked the
young Italian, who was, indeed, a great favorite with all
ladies. He arose to meet her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very, very glad to see you, signior,” she said,
cordially holding out her hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>He bowed over them as he took them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I called to-day, Miss Rosenthal, to pay my respects to
yourself and your learned father, and also to make some
inquiries after——” His voice faltered and broke down,
and then, after an inward struggle for composure, he
added, huskily—“one who is infinitely dearer to me than
my own soul!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie pitied this lover. How could she help it? She
said, gently:</p>

<p class='c007'>“After Alberta Goldsborough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dear Miss Rosenthal. I have heard no word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of her since our violent separation in the latter part of
September, and this is January. I have used every means
to soften the hearts of her parents, but all in vain! I
have written them many letters, but they have been returned
to me unopened. I have besieged their house in
Richmond, but have always been denied admittance, and
once I have been threatened with the police! I, a Corsoni!
But, in the pursuit of my dear love, I would suffer
any ignominy that would not touch my honor!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you all about her. I see no reason in the
world why you should not know. Alberta is a boarder at
the Convent of the Visitation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks! a thousand thanks! It is much to know
where she is. I can at least walk outside the walls and
gaze up to the windows in the hope of seeing my queen
love. Perhaps I may be permitted to write to her. Perhaps
I may have the divine happiness of being allowed to
call on her!” exclaimed the excitable Italian, springing up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no; do not hope it. I am sorry to discourage you,
but I know that she is permitted to correspond only with
a few trusted friends, and that all her letters and her correspondents’
letters pass through the hands of the mother
superior. And she is allowed to see only a certain small
number of visitors upon fixed days, and in the presence of
one of the sisters,” said Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young professor heaved a profound sigh, and inquired:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you the great happiness of being one of the
blessed number who are permitted to visit this angel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie could not restrain a smile at the hyperbolical
language of this lover as she answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I am allowed to visit her; but only in the presence
of one or two of the sisters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, my dear Miss Rosenthal, may I entreat you to
be our good genius and convey one little, little message to
my love?” said Corsoni, clasping his hands imploringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very sorry to refuse you, signior; but, even if
it were right for me to take your message, I should not
be allowed to deliver it,” answered Erminie, very gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! what an unfortunate man I am! Miss Rosenthal,
if you cannot take a message, since you would not
be permitted to deliver it, can you not take one little,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>little letter? You could easily deliver a little, little letter
unknown to the sentinel sisters,” entreated the lover,
again clasping his hands and bringing his beautiful eyes
to bear upon her with all the force of which they were
capable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot, signior! I am very sorry to refuse you, but
I cannot. It would be a very great breach of faith on my
part to do as you wish me. I am trusted by Alberta’s
parents, and I must be faithful to my trust,” said Erminie,
seriously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You draw hair breadth lines of distinction, my too
good Miss Rosenthal,” said the signior, rising, in ill-suppressed
displeasure, to take his leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have faith and hope, and the patience that springs
from both, signior. In time all will be well,” said Erminie,
gently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you, my much-too-good Miss Rosenthal! I
will have faith and hope; but I will have no patience! I
will not wait for time; but all shall be well because I will
make it so! Good-morning, my very-much-too-good
young lady!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Vittorio Corsoni, with a deeply-injured look,
bowed himself out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie, smiling at the Italian’s half-suppressed vehemence,
went upstairs to her needlework.</p>

<p class='c007'>Corsoni, after leaving the Lutheran minister’s house,
walked rapidly to a cab stand, threw himself into a carriage,
and gave the order:</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the Convent of the Visitation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the carriage started.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reclined back in his seat, looking grim, moody and
sardonic, until, at the end of about three-quarters of an
hour, the carriage reached to within a hundred yards of
the convent wall. There he stopped it, got out and dismissed
it, and continued his way on foot, until he reached
the front of the convent. There he walked up and down
before the building, gazing up at the windows and debating
with himself whether he should boldly go up to
grand entrance and ask to see Miss Goldsborough, with
the great probability of being refused and suspected and
watched; or whether he should wait to mature a plot he
had formed of seeing her by stratagem. The first plan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>suited him well, except in the small chance of success it
offered; and the second plan would have suited him, for
his Italian spirit delighted in stratagem, but that his impetuous
nature detested the process of waiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was thus debating with himself, he noticed
the front door open, and little girls, singly or in twos and
threes, and then in larger numbers, issue forth and hurry
away in various directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>And he easily divined that this hour was the midday
recess of the institution, and that these children were the
day pupils going to their respective homes in the neighborhood
for dinner, and that in an hour or two they would
return for the afternoon session of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>And that “second plan” which had been vaguely forming
in his mind, immediately took distinct shape and
color, and sprung to maturity.</p>

<p class='c007'>He hastened to the nearest restaurant and ordered
luncheon for himself. And while it was being got ready
he asked for writing materials and wrote a letter. Very
soon he dispatched his luncheon, and then, with his prepared
letter in his hand, he started once more for the
convent. On his way thither he stopped at a confectioner’s
and bought a quantity of French candy, with
which he filled his pockets.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he got back before the convent walls he found,
as he had expected, the day pupils returning to school for
the afternoon session. They came in as they had gone
out—singly, or in twos or threes, or in larger numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vittorio stood under a tree, apparently engaged in
reading a newspaper, but really in watching the countenances
of the returning children. Nearly all had gone
in, and Vittorio began to despair of the success of his
plan. At length all seemed to have gone in, for not another
one appeared, and the door was closed, and Vittorio
quite despaired of the success of his plan. But, as
he was turning away, with a most heartbroken expression
of countenance, he met a beautiful little girl of about
nine years of age, dressed in deep mourning, and carrying
a satchel of books. He knew that she must be a day
pupil of the convent school, and that she was behind time.
This little girl, meeting the handsome, melancholy and
most interesting young Italian, looked up in his face with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>that wistful expression of sympathy which is so often
seen in the faces of children when they are contemplating
the troubled brows of older people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vittorio Corsoni knew in an instant that he had met
the sort of little girl for whom he had patiently waited.</p>

<p class='c007'>He immediately addressed her:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear child, are you a pupil of that convent
school?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir,” answered the tiny woman, gently, while her
wistful face seemed to say, “Poor fellow! what can I do
to help you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know a young lady who boards there by the
name of—Miss Alberta Goldsborough?” he inquired, in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, sir,” she answered, quickly, while her speaking
face expressed the thought, “Oh, this is the sweetheart
she is hidden from!” For you may be sure, my
readers, that there are very few secrets in this world; and
the real reason why Miss Goldsborough had been sent to
that convent school was whispered about among the older
pupils, and this little girl had heard of it; and all her sympathies
were with the lovers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You love Miss Goldsborough, of course, and would
do anything to make her happy, I am sure,” said the
Italian, in a persuasive voice, fixing his large, lustrous,
melancholy eyes with mesmeric effect upon the sensitive
child’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I do not love her so very much. She is so still
and proud,” began the truthful child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is because she is ill-used and unhappy, my dear,”
said Vittorio, persuasively, keeping his beautiful, sorrowful
eyes fixed upon the little girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am unhappy, too! I have lost my dear mother!”
said the child.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you, my darling? Then may the blessed Mother
of Christ be your mother, and comfort you,” said Vittorio,
plaintively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But that does not make me sullen! And although
Miss Goldsborough will not let me love her much, I do
think I would do anything to please her; and I do know
I would do anything in the world to please you, so you
wouldn’t look so very, very miserable!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Would you, my little angel? You are a little angel of
goodness! Would you take a letter from me to Miss
Goldsborough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, sir, that I would!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And could you give it to her—secretly?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, sir, I know I could!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without any one but herself seeing you do it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, little darling of my eyes and heart, will you
take this to her?” said Vittorio, handing his prepared letter
to the little girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed, I will, sir! and nobody shall know anything
about it but Miss Goldsborough,” answered the
child, with her countenance all radiant with the delight
of delighting, as she hid the letter in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be here this evening, when the school is dismissed,
waiting to see you. Will you bring me the answer
to that letter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, indeed, sir, that I will, if she writes it and
gives it to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, little Seraph! And now look here! here are
some delicious French <em>bonbons</em>—whole boxes full of
them. Take them, my dear, and share them with your
schoolmates,” said Vittorio, emptying his pockets of their
sweet contents.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XX.<br> <span class='c005'>SUCCESS IN THE CHASE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Alberta Goldsborough had been a pupil in the convent
school for somewhat more than four months. In all that
time she had not once heard from her lover. She bore
her trial with great stoicism, disdaining to complain, and
doing all that was required of her with quiet indifference.
She made no friends either among the teachers or the
pupils. She was, as the little girl described her to be,
proud and still. She felt sure that some time or other
Vittorio would, with his Italian craft, succeed in discovering
her retreat and effecting her deliverance. And she
calmly awaited the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Julie McKnight, the little girl whom Vittorio had intrusted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>with the letter to his ladylove, watched all the
afternoon for an opportunity of delivering it to Miss
Goldsborough. Chance favored her. She was sent by her
class mistress into one of the small music-rooms to practice
her lesson on the piano. As she passed on the long
hall, flanked on each side by a row of such rooms, she saw
the door of one of them open and Miss Goldsborough
seated at the piano. The child cast a hurried look up and
down the hall, and, seeing no one near, she slipped in and
thrust the letter into Alberta’s hands, whispering eagerly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“He gave it to me outside. You are to answer it,
please, and give me the answer to take to him. You had
better make haste, please, and write it and give it to me
before we have to go down in the classrooms again. I
am in the music-room, number seven.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, my dear——” began Alberta; but the little
girl did not wait to hear thanks. She was off like an
arrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Goldsborough opened her letter and read:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>My Own and Only Love</span>:—I have but a few minutes to write
to you in; if I would seize the earliest opportunity of getting this
letter into your hands I must have it ready in a quarter of an
hour. After long months of unremitting and unavailing search, I
have but just learned the place of your incarceration. Oh, my
beloved, my adored, my worshiped queen, you know that I would
die to deliver you. Events are on the wing, sweet love, that may
separate us—‘it may be for years, or it may be forever’—unless
we meet and unite our destinies immediately. I have neither
time nor opportunity to explain farther. Let <a id='t136'></a>it suffice for me
to say that I will be on the watch outside the north front of the
building every evening from six o’clock p. m. to six a. m. I will
have a carriage and horses waiting near, but out of sight. Dear
love! if you can effect your escape from the inside of those jealous
walls I will secure your safety on the outside. Or if you will
give me a hint as to how I can further aid your deliverance, I will
risk my life—nay, more—my eternal salvation to serve you. And
always, for time and for eternity, I devote myself body and soul
to your service.</p>

<p class='c006'>Alberta read this with flushed cheeks and beaming
eyes. Before she had finished it her plan was formed.
Ever since she had been in the convent all the senses and
faculties of her mind and body had been on the alert to
discover the best means of escape. And she knew them
and she might have availed herself of them long before,
but for this one consideration—she was ignorant of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>whereabouts of her lover, and she was destitute of any
other refuge. Out of the convent, where could she have
found Vittorio, or where could she have gone for shelter?
These unanswered questions held her captive as bolts and
bars could never have done.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now, if she should make her escape, Vittorio would
be outside waiting to receive her. And her resolution
was taken immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had no proper writing materials at hand. But
she took an end of a pencil from her pocket and tore the
blank page from Vittorio’s letter and wrote her answer.
It was very pithy:</p>

<p class='c009'>Be at your post to-night and wait till you see me.</p>

<p class='c006'>She turned his envelope inside out and put her answer
into it, and took it into the little music-room where the
child, Julia McKnight, was practicing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will give this to the gentleman as you go home,”
she said, handing the letter to the little girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, that I will, Miss Goldsborough. I am so glad
you wrote the answer to his letter. He will be delighted
to get it,” replied little Julia, hiding the letter in
her bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two could not remain long together. Their
interview was altogether against the rules of the school,
where the elder and the younger pupils were not allowed
to associate, except in the presence of their teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, as soon as the affair that had brought them together
was thus far concluded, they separated, the cold
Alberta warming with gratitude enough to stoop and kiss
her ardent little friend before leaving her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alberta returned to her own room. And when the inspecting
sister came around she found the two pupils diligently
practicing at their respective pianos.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the hours for study were over for that afternoon,
and the day pupils were dismissed, little Julia hurried
away to deliver the letter to its destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alberta, in furtherance of her plan of escape, went to
the large apartment known as the recreation-room, where
the boarding pupils always spent their play time in bad
weather. The windows on one side of this apartment
overlooked the north road, where she had warned Vittorio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>to be upon his post. When she entered this room
she found many of her schoolmates assembled, and the
question, “What shall we play?” eagerly discussed among
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you,” said Alberta.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What? what?” demanded the girls, pressing around
her in much surprise that the still, proud Miss Goldsborough
should move in any play.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hide and seek. It is a fine, exhilarating play for a
cold winter afternoon,” said Alberta.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that will be just the thing,” replied the girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the ever-increasing astonishment of her companions,
Miss Goldsborough engaged eagerly in the play, but not
successfully at first, for she caught no one. At length,
however, when the afternoon deepened into night, and
the gas was lighted, and the snow was falling very fast,
Alberta succeeded in finding the hider. Then it was her
turn to hide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, mind,” she said, addressing her companions,
“you must act fairly, and go quite out of sight, and refrain
from watching me. I mean to hide where none of
you have hidden before. You will have great difficulty in
finding me, but I assure you it will be good fun when you
do find me. Don’t come back until I call ‘Whoop!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, we won’t, Alberta!” exclaimed several of her
companions in a breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>And they all hurried out into the passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alberta stole behind them, and not only closed the door
upon them, but silently slipped the bolt. Then she went
to the only other door of the room, which was at the opposite
end, and she drew the key from the other side and
locked it fast. Having thus secured the room, she went
to the north windows. The green linen blinds were
drawn down, and the outside shutters were closed. She
stopped at a window at the extreme end of the row, and
the most out of the range of vision of any one who
might, at a later hour, force an entrance into the room,
and she lifted the blind, but did not draw it up, and she
hoisted the window and opened the shutters. It was dark
as pitch outside, and snowing fast; it was a terrible night
to take the road in. But what will not a self-willed girl,
bent upon her own destruction, venture? She leaned far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>out of the window and peered into the darkness, but she
could see nothing except the falling snow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she ventured to call softly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vittorio! Vittorio!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no response. After a minute she called
again, but with no better success. She paused another
minute, and then called for a third time:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vittorio!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am here, my love—I am here!” answered a hushed
and vehement voice below the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have called you three times,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must have been at the other end of my beat. I have
been pacing the whole length of this building from one
end to the other, and looking up to those windows—oh,
how longingly!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is all clear below this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, dear love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then wait there. I will be with you in a moment,”
she said, and she withdrew from the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her schoolmates, who had grown impatient at her long
delay in hiding, were now clamoring for admittance at the
closed door, which, however, they did not know was fastened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you ‘whoop’ and let us in? Haven’t you
hid yourself yet?” inquired one and another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” answered Alberta, going up to the door—“not
quite yet; I shall in a minute. Don’t you be in such a
hurry, and don’t come in until I whoop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make haste, then,” exclaimed several of the girls in a
breath; “it is cold out here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will,” said Alberta. And she went to the peg where
her own everyday bonnet and shawl hung, and she took
them down and put them on. Next she turned off the
gas, leaving the room dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she went to the window, pushed it up as high
as it would go, got upon the sill, letting the blind drop
behind her to hide her means of exit, and took a clear
leap down to the sidewalk below. It was a fall of about
eight feet, and she came down with a severe shock but
with whole bones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My own! my own! are you hurt?” exclaimed her
lover, in the extremity of anxiety, as he picked her up.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“I—let me recover myself! No, I am not hurt,” answered
Alberta, confusedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The carriage is round the corner. Let me lift you
and bear you to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I can walk very well now, if you will give me the
support of your arm,” answered Miss Goldsborough.</p>

<p class='c007'>He drew her hand through his arm, and carefully
conducted her to the waiting carriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>How long her school companions remained outside the
door of the recreation room, clamoring to come in; or
when their patience became exhausted; or how they affected
an entrance; or whether they gave the alarm; or
who first discovered her flight, Alberta never knew and
never cared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her lover placed her in a carriage and drove her immediately
to the dwelling of a clergyman, where, with
the special license Vittorio had taken care to provide,
they were married; for in the District of Columbia there
is no law to prevent a minor marrying, without the consent
of parents or guardians, at any hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the house of the officiating clergyman they
went to a hotel, where they remained until the next
morning, when they took the boat to Richmond.</p>

<p class='c007'>You see Vittorio Corsoni, with all his faults, did not
shrink from facing his father-in-law. In the Italian’s
creed, love was law, and in his inmost soul he was unconscious
of having done a great wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was no chance of Vittorio’s meeting Mr.
Goldsborough in Richmond just then. The very boat
upon which the newly-married pair embarked, and which
had reached the Washington wharf late on the evening
before, had brought up Alberta’s father on a visit to herself.
As it was too late for him to see his daughter that
night, and as the hotels were almost uncomfortably
crowded, the old gentleman decided to quarter himself
upon his good friend, the retired Lutheran minister.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed that Erminie had been booked for surprises
that day, and that the tribe of cousins or friends as
numerous as a Scotch clan, of which her father had jestingly
spoken, were really beginning to pour in. She had
scarcely curtsied Vittorio Corsoni out, before a cab rolled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>up to the door and her two uncles, Hans and Friedrich
Rosenthal, got out of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hans had suddenly come from Germany the day before,
and they had both come on to see their brother
Ernest, the retired Lutheran minister.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie welcomed them with the warmest affection,
and showed them into a spare room, where she hastened
to have a fire lighted, and to make them comfortable;
and then she dispatched Catharine to the Congress Library
to look for her father and tell him of the arrival of his
brothers, so that he might hurry home. The old Lutheran
minister came with the messenger, his face beaming with
joy, and embraced his brothers warmly in his earnest
German manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth did not appear until the six o’clock
dinner, when he was introduced to the strangers. He
was, as often now, moody and preoccupied; but even he
could not long resist the influence of that cordial spirit of
love which seemed to pervade the Lutheran minister’s
family.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was some time after they had had tea in the library,
and had gone into the drawing-room, and it was while
Erminie, her uncles and her lover were at the piano, singing
some of the finest selections from the German operas,
that the doorbell rang and Mr. Goldsborough was announced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Dr. Rosenthal started up with the agility of youth
to welcome his friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie stopped singing and playing, and turned
around with a frightened look. Her first impression, that
came quick as lightning at the sight of Mr. Goldsborough,
was that he had come to Washington in fierce pursuit of
Vittorio Corsoni; but she arose to receive her father’s
guest with all the calmness and courtesy she could command.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Goldsborough’s first words somewhat allayed her
fears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You look surprised and even shocked to see me here
so unexpectedly, at this late hour, my dear young lady;
but you will be pleased to learn that I have come to withdraw
your friend, my daughter Alberta, from her convent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>school,” said Mr. Goldsborough, cordially shaking her
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very glad to see you at any hour,” replied Erminie,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks! The boat was behind time in getting in, or
I should not have been so unseasonable in my appearance,”
added Mr. Goldsborough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not unseasonable at all, my old friend. It is
not yet eleven o’clock. And we had not begun to think
of retiring. For, you see, here are my two brothers, just
arrived, and one come all the way from Germany! Let
me present them to you: Mr. Hans Rosenthal, Mr.
Friedrich Rosenthal—Mr. Goldsborough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Virginia gentleman bowed with old-fashioned ceremoniousness
as the simple-hearted German merchants
were introduced. And then he sat down and became one
of the party.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you supped?” hospitably inquired the young
mistress of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dear, on the boat. Give yourself no trouble,”
said Mr. Goldsborough, with a bow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very glad that you are going to take my favorite,
Alberta, out of the convent,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! my doing so before the half-yearly term has expired
may seem very capricious; but, in fact, it is not so.
There are grave reasons why all we Virginians should
gather all the scattered members of our families under our
own State roofs. The progress of public affairs makes it
imperative that I should take my daughter home, or risk
the being separated from her for a long and indefinite
period. I believe that I am speaking among friends and
sympathizers here—the presence of Colonel Eastworth in
this house, indeed, assures me that I am. And I know,
also, that my esteemed host, although not a native of the
country, has been a citizen of the South for many years.
I may, therefore, say that Virginia will certainly secede
from the United States, and that she is now arming herself
in defense of her right to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No one answered for a while. But the speaker caught
the eye of Colonel Eastworth, who was looking at him
with a steady and meaning gaze, that was intended to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>convey the impression that the subject must not be pursued,
and must never be resumed in that house.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, after a thoughtful pause, Dr. Rosenthal
spoke; but he spoke rather wide of the mark; for though
nothing could have been plainer than the words used by
Mr. Goldsborough, and although Dr. Rosenthal understood
the meaning of those words, yet he strangely misunderstood
the position assumed by the speaker. He
honestly supposed that the Virginian gentleman, in speaking
of secession, spoke of it only as deprecating its evils.
This was very apparent in his answer:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say that Virginia will certainly secede from the
United States, and that she is even now arming herself
in defense of her right to do so! Nonsense, Goldsborough!
Don’t alarm yourself! There is, certainly, an
epidemical madness in the air, and a few leading statesmen
have caught it. South Carolina has gone, it is true!
She took the malady in its most malignant form. Let us
hope that she will soon get well and come back. But Virginia
secede! The gallant Old Dominion go! Never,
Goldsborough! Don’t distrust your native State, my
friend! She is as loyal to the Union as you are, or as I
am! And, Heaven knows, I love this country, which
has fostered me for forty years—I love her as truly and
as deeply as if I had been born her son! And should this
madness of secession become general, and should she have
a civil war forced upon her, I, with my three score years,
will take up arms in her defense as promptly as you,
Goldsborough, or as Eastworth, or any other loyal and
gallant son of her soil would do!”</p>

<p class='c007'>What a speech was this for the brave and true-hearted
old man to make to a couple of conscientious, but unsuspected
secessionists, who were his honored guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither of them answered a word; they found that they
had mistaken their man; for this was really the first definition
of his position that the Lutheran minister had ever
thought it worth while to make; and Eastworth had supposed
him to be indifferent on the subject; and Goldsborough,
seeing one of the strongest spirits of secession
an inmate of his house, had really believed him to be one
of that party. They were silent from surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Erminie was a picture! She turned upon her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>father, beaming with love, admiration and enthusiasm as
she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right, my dear father! I love to hear you speak so.
And I myself would strap the sword to your side and
place the musket in your hand, and follow you to the field,
if you would let me, to dress your wounds if you should
be hurt, and nurse you if you be sick; and to risk my life
with yours and die with you, if need should be!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, there, my darling; I know you are a brave and
good girl! and there are millions of your countrywomen
like you! for you are a native American citizen, my Minie,
although I am not,” said the Lutheran minister, patting
his daughter on the head. “But there will be no necessity,
let us hope, for all this self-devotion! The clouds
of secession gather rather thickly and darkly just now,
but they will be dispelled—they will be dispelled,” he
added, walking away to the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth took the vacant place beside
Erminie, and stooped and whispered very low:</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what will become of me, my Minie, when you
shall follow your father to the field? Where shall I be,
and who will care for me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be with my father, and I will care for you
both! Surely you will stand shoulder to shoulder with
my father, in defense of our beloved country! And as
surely I shall be near to minister to you both!” answered
Erminie, looking up with surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the hour was late, the party now separated and retired
to their respective rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last thought of Colonel Eastworth, in sinking to
sleep, was:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will come to this—that my beloved Minie must
choose between her loyalty and her lover—and her lover
will be quite sure to triumph!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI.<br> <span class='c005'>ELFRIDA’S ARRIVAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As soon as the early family breakfast was over, Mr.
Goldsborough got ready to go to the convent to fetch
away his daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“You will bring her immediately here, I hope?” said
Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, of course—of course he will,” added Erminie’s
father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you both. I certainly intend to call with Alberta
before leaving town,” replied Mr. Goldsborough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Call with her? Bring her here and make a visit with
her. You surely cannot mean to take her direct from
the convent to the country without giving her a sight of
the city!” exclaimed the old doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must leave Washington this evening at the latest.
The necessity for our return is imperative!” answered
Mr. Goldsborough, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you are anxious to get back, to stem with
all your strength this tendency to secession, or should
you not succeed in that, at least to take care of your
family interests, threatened by State politics. Well, perhaps
you are right,” said the unsuspicious old minister.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Goldsborough’s face flushed scarlet, but that
might have been from the efforts he was making to draw
on a very tight glove, or even from the compression of
the very thick woolen scarf that was wound around his
throat as he stood there booted and greatcoated, and
ready for his start. He answered not a word, but took
his hat from the rack, bowed, and went away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The snow that had been falling all night long, lay deep
upon the ground, and was falling fast still.</p>

<p class='c007'>The old doctor shut the door quickly after his departing
guest, and came back into the library with a renewed
appreciation of the comforts of his own fireside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie ran upstairs to get ready her best spare room
for the reception of Alberta; for though Mr. Goldsborough
had said that he must leave Washington with
his daughter on that same evening, Erminie entertained
hopes that he would change his mind, and pass the day
and night with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>While she was busy having the fire lighted, the bed
linen changed, and the water brought up, thinking all
the time how comfortable and happy she would try to
make her friend Alberta, whether her stay should be
short or long, she received a hasty summons from her
own father.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>She ran downstairs to the lower hall where, to her unbounded
astonishment, she saw Farmer Fielding and his
daughter Elfrida. They had just been admitted by the
servant, and were shaking hands with Dr. Rosenthal,
who had come out of the library to receive them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am so glad, oh, so glad to see you, my darling
Elfie!” exclaimed Erminie, running and catching her
little friend in her arms, and kissing her a dozen times
before she even thought of the elder visitor. When she
did recall his existence, she turned toward him with a
blush and a smile, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Excuse me, Mr. Fielding. I am very happy to see
you. How do you do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Miss Minie, I do as well as any man can
in my circumstances. I have been——” began the
farmer, but he was cut short by the doctor, who finished
the sentence for him in his, the doctor’s, own way.</p>

<p class='c007'>—“‘Exposed to a snowstorm, and I am wet and
cold;’ that’s what he would say, my Minie. Come right
up into my room, farmer, and change your clothes at
once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank ye kindly, no. I’m not wet. We came in a
covered wagon as far as the Drover’s Rest, close by here,
and only walked the little bit from there here. Bless
you, we do look powdered over pretty well, but it’s all on
the outside. It don’t penetrate like some things do, doctor.
No, Miss Minie; the circumstance to which I allude
was the being turned out of my home by a lot of lunatics,
who are also trying to turn the Government upside
down!” said the farmer, beginning to unbutton his overcoat
as he stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie and her father stared in silence for a moment,
and then exclaimed in surprise, and at the same instant:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Driven out of your home, Mr. Fielding!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, driven out of our home—nothing else. Ask my
girl, here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—that was it!” broke in Elfie. “Old Virginny
was made too hot to hold us—literally too hot. In short,
our houses were burned over our heads, and we should
have been burned in it if we hadn’t made good our
escape.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“You shock me beyond measure!” exclaimed the minister,
in consternation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my dear Elfie, what a misfortune! How did that
happen? But don’t try to tell me here, my darling.
Come up to my room and change your clothes first,”
said Erminie, in deep sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no. I can just take off my hood and cloak and
overshoes here, if you please, and let your maid carry
them away. I am dying to tell you all about it. Let us
go into that pleasant-looking room, there. I dare say it
is your usual sitting-room,” said Elfie, nodding her head
toward the open door, while she impatiently tore off her
hood and cloak and kicked off her overshoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is our library, and a favorite room with us all,”
replied Erminie, pushing the door wider open and leading
the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The room was empty. Colonel Eastworth had left the
house soon after Mr. Goldsborough went, and the doctor’s
two brothers, Hans and Friedrich Rosenthal, were
up in the doctor’s snuggery enjoying a good smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie placed chairs round the fire, and the party of
four drew up to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie and her friend sat on one side of the chimney,
and the two gentlemen on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“First of all, though, have you had breakfast?” inquired
Dr. Rosenthal, while Erminie placed her hand
upon the bell, ready to ring and give orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, thank ye; we had a very good breakfast at
the Drover’s,” replied the farmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then tell us all about this affair,” urged the doctor,
earnest in his sympathy and eager in his curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ask my girl here; she’ll tell ye. She knows a deal
more about it than I do,” said the farmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell us all about it, Elfie, darling,” said Erminie, affectionately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t you be afraid but what I’ll tell you all about
it. I’ve been dying to do so ever since it happened.
First, you must know it was all my doings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The burning of your father’s house, my dear?” exclaimed
Erminie in horror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but the provocation of those who did burn it.
The first public act of my life resulted in getting our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>house burned over our heads! Encouraging, wasn’t it?
It was all my fault!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was all her glory, she should say, Miss Minie!”
put in the farmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a mere matter of opinion, pap. The glory or
the shame of my act is an open question that will be settled
in quite opposite manners by opposing parties. The
Secessionist will call it an act of treason! The Unionist
will say it is an act of patriotism! The first will call me
a wretch; the second will say I am a heroine. All I say
about the matter is, that it was all my doings, because I
am a self-willed little party, who don’t like contradiction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see I must tell the story myself,” put in the farmer.
“Well, I suppose you know there is a pretty strong
secesh feeling down there in Virginny?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have heard so, I am very sorry to say,” replied the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless you, yes; and down our way——Whew! Why,
as far back as last Christmas, when our Virginia boys,
who were at college in Washington, came home for the
holidays, they made their boast that when they went back
to Washington it would be behind the ‘red-cross’ banner
(whatever in the deuce’s name that might be), to the
sound of drum and bugle, and with swords and muskets
to take the city. Bosh! I let the lads talk. I didn’t
even think it even worth while to contradict them. I
only thought they were a little more inflated with gas
than ever college boys usually are, and I considered their
blowing it off a necessary process.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I heard the talk of Secessionists very much in the same
spirit. I could not believe it real,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but the jest has become very serious now. The
madness has spread, and is spreading. Our neighborhood
is a regular hotbed of secession. A few weeks ago I had
occasion to go to Winchester with my two brothers. It
was a lawsuit that took us there. In fact, we were subpœnaed
as witnesses in the great case of Trowbridge
<em>versus</em> Kay, and we had to go, and the case detained us
there more than a fortnight. I will just observe here that
on our road to Winchester we noticed at every public
house, post office, blacksmith and country store, and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>ever so many private houses, banners raised, and bearing
such mottoes as these: ‘Secession;’ ‘The Southern Confederacy;’
‘No Compromise;’ ‘State’s Rights,’ and so
forth. I didn’t see one Star-Spangled Banner in the
whole route! Well, meantime, you know, I left my little
Elfie at home, with no one to protect her but the negroes.
Bless you, I thought she was as safe as safe could be!
Now you tell what happened after I went away, Elfie, for
you know more about it than I do,” said the farmer, turning
to his little daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew he’d break down in the story. He’d better let
me told it from the first. Well, when pap and my two
unks had gone and left me alone, with the old blind mare,
the cow, the pigs and the darkies, I got into mischief the
first thing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you did,” said Dr. Rosenthal, laughing.
“‘When the cat’s away the mice will play!’ But what
particular species of mischief did you get into?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! ‘thereby hangs a tale,’ and not a mouse’s tail
neither. Well, seeing so many strange new flags flying
round, I thought I would just hoist the old one, for fear
people might forget its existence. The only difficulty
in my way was that I hadn’t an old one to hoist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But mark you what she did!” exclaimed her father,
proudly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I made a raid upon our drawing-room and best bedchamber.
There were red moreen curtains hanging up in
one and white cotton in the other; so I took down the
curtains red and white, and tore them into strips, and
sewed them together like the stripes of the dear old flag!
Then I took my blue merino dress and cut out the square
for the stars. Then I cut the stars and sewed them upon
it. It was twenty-four feet long by eight broad. It had
forty-eight stripes and a hundred stars, and it took me a
whole fortnight to make it! When it was done, I had a
misgiving that it was over regulation size, and that there
were more stripes than was lawful, and more stars than
States; but I wasn’t sure, for I had forgotten all about
my geography and history; and, besides, I thought if I
had made a mistake it was certainly on the right side, and
at worst, it was only a prophecy of the future, for the
dear old flag is bound to grow and increase; and if she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>isn’t entitled to a hundred stars now, she will be when we
have annexed South America and the rest of creation!
So I resolved to let my flag fly as I had made it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But where could you expect to find a staff strong
enough to bear it?” inquired Dr. Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was my second difficulty. And I was at my
wits’ ends for a little while. However, there was a tall
Lombardy poplar tree growing before our house. So I
made Ned, our man of all work, take an ax and go up
that tree and shred off all its branches, until it stood up
a bare pole—tall, straight and strong, as the mainmast of
a three-decker. The stumps of the limbs that were lopped
off made very good holds for the feet and hands in climbing.
I made Ned take the flag up to the top of that pole
and nail it there, so that it might never be drawn down!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here Elfie’s father nodded approvingly toward his
host, as if claiming admiration for his daughter, while
little Elfie went on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, they did let Sunday go by without making any
very violent demonstrations against the flag. They confined
themselves to hooting and howling. But bright and
early Monday morning three ruffians came to the house
and rapped. I hadn’t left my room, so I looked out of
the window and saw who they were and guessed what
they came for, and I called down to Ned, who slept in the
hall, not on any account to open the door. And then I
went and hoisted the window and asked what they
wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘We want that blamed flag down!’ roared one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Then want will be your master,’ said I.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘It has no business here! It shall come down!’
howled another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Serve you right!’ said I.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Send out your beastly black man to haul it down!’
growled the third.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Do you good,’ I observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They didn’t seem to see the point of my answers, for
the first one that had spoken broke out into a terrific volley
of imprecations, that was enough to raise the hair up
off my head, only it didn’t! And then he ordered me to
have the flag lowered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You’re another!’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“Then all three began to curse and swear in a horrible
manner. And I began to sing as loud as I could:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Three blind mice! they all ran after the farmer’s
wife!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, still cursing and swearing, like a crew of pirates
in a sea fight, they went to the flagpole and began to
climb it. Seeing which, I went and got father’s gun,
examined it and found it all right. It was a double-barreled
gun; and I carried it to the window and rested it on
the sill and pointed its muzzle toward the top of the pole.
The three men had reached it then, and were tearing
away at the flag to get it loose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Come down!’ I shouted, ‘or as sure as I live I will
fire!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“They answered me with curses. Now, I am no sharpshooter,
so what followed was all owing to chance. Using
the window sill as a rest, I trained the gun as well as I
could, pointed it toward them, and pulled the trigger.
And simultaneously with the flash and the report one of
the men uttered a fierce yell, and fell to the ground. Oh,
Heaven, Minie, what a tremendous revulsion of feeling I
experienced when I thought that I had killed a man! I
do not know whether I could have fired again. However,
the two others did not wait for the discharge of the
second barrel. They slid down that pole like monkeys,
and ran off like quarter horses, leaving their wounded
upon the field. Then I laughed. I could not help it; I
sung out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘See how they run! see how they run!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then, in my excitement, I blazed away at them
with the other barrel. But they were so far off that only
one of them got struck, and in the back, and with a spent
ball, for I saw him stop suddenly, with a great howl, clap
his hands behind him, bend backward, and then run
faster than before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I call that a brilliant victory,” said Farmer Fielding,
nodding toward his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Lutheran minister and his daughter were too
gravely interested in Elfie’s narrative to express any admiration
of her feat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not proud of the victory,” said Elfie, candidly.
“I was delighted with it—elated with it—but not proud of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>it. How could I be? For it is true, I was one girl
against three men, yet I had the great advantage of fighting
behind my entrenchments, while they were exposed.
I had also firearms, which they had not. No, I don’t
think I have any reason to vaunt myself for this easy
victory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the man you shot from the pole! Oh, my dear
Elfie, I hope—I hope he was not killed!” said Erminie,
clasping her hands in the earnestness of her anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as the other two men had run away, I set the
old gun up in its place, and ran downstairs to the hall,
where I found my faithful Ned guarding the door with
an old blunderbuss.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Miss Allfrida!’ he said, ‘I told you we’d have a fight
for the old flag, and we’s had it; and it won’t be the
last, nuther. They’re gone now, but they’ll come back
to-night in stronger numbers.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I don’t care, Ned,’ I said; ‘come one, come all, this
house shall fly from off its firm ground as soon as I!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then I told him to open the door, for I wanted to
go out and look after our wounded prisoner. Lor’,
Minie, when I went up to him I thought he was dead, sure
enough! He was lying on his stomach, with his head,
arm and leg doubled under him. Ned was frightened,
too.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Goodness gracious me alive, Miss Elfie; he’s done
for; and the constables will do for us!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Turn him over, Ned,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ned turned him over, showing a ghastly face turned
up towards the sky. I ran into the house, and brought
out a pitcher of water and a bottle of whisky. And we
dashed the water in his face; but with very little effect.
Then Ned opened his clenched teeth with an oyster knife,
and I uncorked the bottle and poured the whisky down his
throat. Bless you! he swallowed it like mother’s milk.
Did you ever see a baby suck in its sleep? Well, that’s
the way that fellow sucked, in his unconsciousness.
When the bottle was empty, and I drew it from his
mouth, he opened his eyes and began to stare around.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You’ll do!’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then I told Ned to call one of the field negroes
to help him, and to bring the wounded man in, and lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>him on pap’s bed, and then go for the doctor. When the
man was moved, oh! he shrieked out, I tell you. And
when the doctor came and examined his injuries, he found
that my shot had passed through his shoulder, and the
fall from the flagpole had broken his leg. So you see
his injuries, though serious, were not fatal. Later in the
day his friends came, in a large wagon, with a feather bed
and blanket in the bottom of it, and took him away. They
‘cussed sum,’ and threatened loudly to have me arrested
and sent to prison for life. I assured them that I was
justified in what I did, and that the law would sustain
me, and they knew it. Finally they went off, vowing
vengeance against all our tribe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were you not terrified by their threats?” inquired Dr.
Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not then! I was too mad! But, after I had calmed
down and saw that it was growing late and night was
coming on, I began to feel uneasy; because, you see, there
was no one to guard the house but myself and old Ned
and old Cassy! So, very early in the evening, I fastened
up the house, bolting and barring every door and window.
And I loaded three double-barreled guns, and
made other preparations to meet the assault. And I went
up into the attic to watch the approaches to the house.
And, I tell you what, I was glad when I saw pap’s wagon
coming down the road!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” put in Farmer Fielding. “The case of Trowbridge
<em>versus</em> Kay, closed that very morning, and my two
brothers and myself were at liberty to come home. My
two brothers, however, decided to stay over that evening,
to attend a Union meeting, got up to make some little
stand against the progress of the Secessionists. But I was
anxious about my girl, and so I resolved to come home,
and in good time, too, for I found her fortifying the house
to withstand an assault. I was so astonished that my
breath was suspended! But she soon told me what had
happened; and I soon had reason to see the prudence of
her preparations, and also their inefficiency!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a dreadful state of things!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would think so if you had been at our house that
night!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What night was that, by the way?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“Why last Monday night, of course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, certainly—yes! I recollect Miss Elfie’s naming
the day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a day to be remembered in the annals of my
domestic life. Myself and my girl sat up and watched.
But, for all that, I did not believe that our own old
neighbors would pull the house down over our heads,
merely because we were loyal to the old Union and the
old flag. But what will not maniacs do? Myself and
my brave girl watched until near daybreak, when, thinking
that all was right for the time being, and that we
would not have an attack that night, we separated, and
went to bed, to get an hour or two of repose before
breakfast. I had been some time asleep when I was
rudely awakened by a terrific yell—such a yell as a
hand of painted savages, armed with firebrands and tomahawks,
might roar forth in surprising a peaceful home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sprang up and rushed to the window and threw up
the sash and looked out. The eastern horizon was quite
red, and by its light I saw a crowd of men armed with
guns, pistols, swords, pitchforks and a variety of
weapons, gathered around the house. As I bent out to
look down, I saw a quantity of straw, shavings and dry
brushwood piled around the posts that supported the
porch. The moment they saw me they saluted me with a
perfect howl of rage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Come out of that, you——’ Here followed a volley
of profane and indecent imprecations and vituperations—‘come
out of that house with your devil’s imp of a
daughter, unless you wish to be burned alive inside of it!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Before I could reply, my brave girl, who had heard
the row, was by my side. She put a gun into my hand
and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Pap, I have called up Ned, and he can do good service.
Now you take this gun, and fire into them from
this window, and I will fire from the other. And we’ll
keep it up as long as the ammunition lasts; and then
we’ll die game, pap!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I turned to answer my girl, to tell her not to show herself
at the other window—to be careful; but she was gone—she
was already before the other window, and training
the gun so that its muzzle should be in a line with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>crowd below. I did the same at my window. We fired
at the same moment, and our fire was answered by a roar
of rage and a discharge of musketry. The shots rattled
against the front of the house, and shivered the windows,
shutters and sashes. I trembled for my girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Elfie, for Heaven’s sake, leave the window! fall flat
upon the floor,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Not if I know it, pap,’ she answered; ‘not while I
have a shot left to send at the enemy.’ And, so saying,
she blazed away with her other barrel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did the same with my other; and again we were answered
by a volley of musketry; and again the shot rattled
against the walls, and split the timber of the window
frames. I saw my brave girl fall, and, in an agony
of terror, I threw down my gun, and ran and raised her
up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I’m all right, pap,’ she said. ‘It was only my gun
kicked and knocked me down; and, now, if you don’t
load up and let ’em have it again, you are no pap of mine!
I’ll disinherit you!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, notwithstanding her words, I bore her into a
back room, where she would be safe from the shots; and,
even as I carried her away, I saw the smoke and flames
rising from the outside of the house, and heard the rioters
roar forth with many fierce curses:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Come out of that, or be burned alive in it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I laid my girl on the bed, in the back room, and hastened
to my own room, where I secured my little money
and valuable papers. While I was hiding them about my
person, old Ned came to the door and whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Massa, massa, for de Lord’s sake, come away! Take
Miss Elfie by main force, if she won’t give in any other
way, and come! I’m got the wagon and horses at the
back door.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ned,’ said I, ‘come with me to Miss Elfie’s room, and
tell her the state of affairs.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And we went to my girl’s room, and I got her clothes,
and ordered her to dress herself quickly, and threatened
if she did not do so, to take her just as she was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Oh, if I am to contend with foes outside and cowards
inside, of course I shall have to evacuate! And I will do
it decently!’ said my girl. And she got ready very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>quickly, and went down the back stairs to the back door,
where Ned had the wagon ready. And I put my girl
into it and got in beside her; and Ned mounted the
driver’s seat, and we set off by the back road and made
our escape. And here we are! But if it had not been
for the thought of my dear, brave girl, I should have
stayed there and defied the mob to the utmost!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it hadn’t been for the thought of me! Well, now,
I like that! That’s cool!” exclaimed Elfie; “especially
when, by your own showing, pap, if it had not been for
you and Ned and the kicking gun, I should have stood my
ground and died game, or driven off the assailants on the
last occasion as I had done on the first. I’m sure I did
very well on that first occasion, when I hadn’t you to help
me, pap! But on the last! Well, what could I do with
fiery-hearted foes outside raging to get in, and faint-hearted
friends inside crying to get out; and my very
weapon recoiling upon me and kicking me down! I tell
you all what! I fought against fearful odds on every
hand! Joan of Arc herself would have given in under
such circumstances! Not that I would, if it hadn’t been
for that cowardly pap of mine!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think either you or your papa have reason to
be ashamed of your conduct on that occasion. ‘What
could you ’gainst the shock of hell?’” said Dr. Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, anyhow, I know what I’ll do next time. If ever
I find myself in command of a domestic castle in siege, I’ll
lock pap up in his bedroom till the fight’s over. You hear
that good, don’t you pap?” said pap’s daughter, saucily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Elfie, my darling, where have you left that good
old negro who rescued you from the burning house?”
inquired Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he’s all right. He is at the Drover’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know, Elfie, he would be quite welcome in our
kitchen. Our servants would take care of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Thanky, honey,’ as Ned would say; he is very well
where he is. Besides, pap and I haven’t come to quarter
ourselves upon you so suddenly. We only wanted to see
the smiling faces of friends after having seen the frowning
faces of so many foes. That is all. Presently we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>intend to go out and look for a boarding-house where we
can stop for the present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, you will do no such thing, Miss Elfie! In the
first place, there are no boarding-houses but what are
already crowded. In the second place, here is my house,
open to receive any of my friends at any time, and especially
wide open to welcome any number of friends for
any length of time, who have suffered from their devotion
to this Union which has fostered me for nearly fifty years!
So, friend Fielding, you will please make yourself at
home where you are,” said Dr. Rosenthal, with earnest
sincerity in every word, tone and look.</p>

<p class='c007'>Farmer Fielding put out his sturdy hand and shook the
fat fist of the good doctor, as he replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank ye, minister! for the present I accept your kind
invitation, the more especially as I shall be backward and
forward from here to Virginia, and sha’n’t like to leave
my little girl alone in a boarding-house. Thank ye,
kindly, minister! We’ll stop with you a bit, until we can
turn ourselves round.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s settled, then! And now I am happy to tell you
that to-day you will meet an old friend of yours here,”
said Dr. Rosenthal, cordially.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An old friend of mine? Humph! I should like to
see one besides yourself. Nearly all my old friends have
become Secessionists, and are no longer friends of mine!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, but this one hasn’t. He is loyal to the Union,
and is very much disturbed in his mind on account of the
spread of the Secession spirit through his native State.
I am speaking of Mr. Goldsborough, of Richmond,” said
the unsuspicious old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Goldsborough! One of the rip-stavingest Secessionists
in the State—one of the moving spirits of secession!—a
leader among them!” exclaimed Farmer Fielding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who, Goldsborough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you not mistaken?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a bit of it! He has been stumping the State,
making secession speeches in every congressional district.
I heard him make one, in our neighborhood, at the Bull’s
Head Tavern. Who do you think replied to it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know, I am sure. I am so astonished to hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>that Goldsborough is a Secessionist that I am filled with
perplexity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Vittorio Corsoni answered him. You know that
there is no love lost between Goldsborough and Corsoni;
and Goldsborough being a Secessionist might have been
cause enough to make Corsoni a Unionist; though I have
observed that naturalized foreigners, who have been protected
by our Government, have been among the most
zealous in its defense, and if this matter ever comes to
blows, they will strike good ones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then the doorbell rang violently, and when the
servant ran in haste to see the cause of the noisy summons,
Mr. Goldsborough burst into the house, and then
into the library. His face was inflamed, his features distorted,
and his eyes flashing with passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For Heaven’s sake, Goldsborough, what has happened?”
exclaimed Dr. Rosenthal, rising, in alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What? She has gone! Fled from the convent!”
roared the enraged man, throwing his hat upon one chair,
and his gloves upon another, and without noticing any
one in the room, except his host; “yes, brought dishonor
upon all her family! And may the curses of——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush!” said the minister, laying his hand gently upon
the lips of the speaker; “no curses, Goldsborough. Sit
down quietly and compose yourself, and tell us all about
it. See, here is Mr. Fielding and his daughter, your old
friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you do, Fielding? How are you, Miss Elfie?
I beg your pardon for not seeing you! But you will not
wonder at a man being blind with rage when his only
daughter has disgraced herself and her family,” said Mr.
Goldsborough, gruffly enough, as he coldly shook hands
with Elfie and her “pap.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh no, Mr. Goldsborough, not so bad as that! Young
people will sometimes choose for themselves, you know.
And though their choice may be indiscreet, and even unfortunate,
it need not be disgraceful. Try to calm yourself,
and make the best of it! The young man is something
of a monkey, to be sure; but I believe him to be a
well-meaning monkey!” urged the farmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>And all party politics seemed for a moment forgotten
in the interest felt in this domestic calamity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Sit down, Mr. Goldsborough! Do sit down and compose
yourself! And let us hear the details of this flight,”
entreated the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I cannot sit down! And I will not compose myself!
I will pursue the abductor of my daughter, and
shoot him wherever I find him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how do you know who was the abductor, if it
comes to that?” inquired the farmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! I know well enough! A fellow, answering to
the description of this Corsoni, was seen lurking around
the convent all day yesterday! Besides, you know, she
would have run off with no one else! Good-by, Fielding!
Good-by, Rosenthal! Young ladies, your servant!” said
Mr. Goldsborough, seizing up his hat and gloves, and
leaving the house before the startled company had recovered
from their astonishment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII.<br> <span class='c005'>ANOTHER TRIAL FOR ELFIE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>All unknown and unsuspected by the good Lutheran
minister, his house became the headquarters of consultation,
and he became involved in a network of circumstantial
evidence that at a later period might have brought
him before a military commission, or placed him on the
scaffold.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had discovered that Mr. Goldsborough was a Secessionist;
and for that reason he was very glad to get rid of
that gentleman’s presence; but he knew that Farmer
Fielding was a good Union man, and he believed that
Colonel Eastworth was as loyal as himself—Ernest
Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth, over and above his strong love for
the Lutheran minister’s beautiful child, had another great
motive for remaining the guest of Dr. Rosenthal; it was
this: That under the cover of one who was so well
known to be a stanch and loyal man, he might, with less
suspicion and more safety, perfect certain plans. Under
this roof he daily and nightly received many visitors with
whom he held long interviews in his own rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Dr. Rosenthal never dreamed of inquiring into the motives,
conduct or character of his guest’s visitors. They
would come at almost any hour of the twenty-four, ring
the bell, inquire for Colonel Eastworth, and be shown up
to his rooms, either to see him, if he should be in, or to
wait for him, if he should be out.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Colonel Eastworth was out a great deal, especially
in the evening. At length, so well were his plans organized
that his co-conspirators knew very well at what
hour to call and find him in; and he would be in his
rooms all day busily writing and sending off letters, or receiving
visitors; and half the night he would be out. Erminie
saw but little of him at this period.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening, when he came into the drawing-room, before
going out, she gently rallied him on what she gayly
called his “going on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you off to now?” she inquired, with affectionate
freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear love, the lodge,” he answered, after some little
hesitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe the lodge meets every night! And you
are away every night!” she gayly remonstrated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear love, this lodge does meet every night,” he answered,
seriously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I declare, one would think, to see and hear you, that
you nightly met conspirators who were darkly plotting
‘the ruin of themselves and land!’” laughed Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>But how little she dreamed how much truth she had
spoken!</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth also laughed—a strange, unnatural
laugh—that chilled Erminie’s blood; and then he kissed
her and went away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of Colonel Eastworth’s visitors were strangers to
the old minister’s family, and even to the rest of his staying
guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>But one morning Elfie had a great surprise. She was
running downstairs, singing, “Gay and happy,” when
suddenly she met, face to face on the stairs, her lover,
Albert Goldsborough, who had just been admitted and
was on his way up to Colonel Eastworth’s rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfie!” he cried, stopping short and staring at her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“Well, I do think! Where did you come from?” she
exclaimed, stopping and gazing at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had no idea that you were in this house,” he said,
meaningly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I had no notion that you were coming to it. So
you don’t follow me here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I came to see Colonel Eastworth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It appears to me that there are a great many people
coming to see Colonel Eastworth. I don’t know anybody
that sees so many people, except it is that old door-keeper
at the White House! But you won’t see Colonel Eastworth
this morning. He is generally in, holding a levee
in his rooms all day long; but this morning the queerest-looking
fellow that ever I saw came after him and carried
him away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What sort of a looking fellow, Elfie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A great, tall, broad-shouldered man, with little, tiny
head. They got in a carriage together. I heard him tell
the coachman to drive to Benning’s Bridge. Now, that
is four miles from this, and, if they are going any distance
over that bridge, they won’t be back till evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! humph! humph!” muttered Albert, reflectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“However, as this house is certainly Liberty Hall, you
can stop and wait for him,” suggested Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not altogether sorry to miss him, just now that I
have met you, dear Elfie. My business with him can wait
till evening. And I wish so much to talk with you, Elfie.
Oh, I am so glad to see you! It is such an unexpected
pleasure. Are you glad to see me, love?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had a little rather see you than not, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No more than that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—no more than that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I am happy—so happy to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Happy, are you? Well, you don’t look so; and, indeed,
I haven’t seen anybody look happy for the last six
months. Of all the glum wretches that ever existed, all
my fellow creatures are getting to be the glummest.
Happy! if that is your happy look, I wonder what your
dismal one is like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense, Elfie dear, this is no time for raillery.
‘Great events are on the wing.’ Men have heavy responsibilities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>just now, as you must know, living in this house.
I cannot talk to you on the stairs, dear. Is there no place
where you can take me for a quiet <em>tête-à-tête</em>?” inquired
Albert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; there is the library and the drawing-room, both
unoccupied at this hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take me to the place where we shall be least liable to
interruption.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come to the library, then,” said Elfie, leading the way
thither.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were seated before the fire, Albert inquired:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long have you been here, Elfie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For several weeks. Ever since our house was burned
over our heads.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your house burned over your heads!” exclaimed Albert,
in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and we would have been lynched if we had not
made our escape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, the violence of these Unionists in Virginia is
certainly as horrible as anything in the Reign of Terror!”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the word “Unionists” Elfie stared. Then, as it
dawned upon her mind that Albert was a Secessionist,
that he took her for one, and that he supposed her house
to have been burned by the Unionists, she grew very pale;
but in the interests of her country she kept silent, and involuntarily
she played the spy. Elfie, with her bitter experiences
of secession persecutions, and with her keen
perceptions, had begun to suspect the loyalty of Colonel
Eastworth, and of all those strange visitors who came to
see him in his rooms. But up to this time her suspicion
was not strong enough to justify her interference in any
way. Now, however, by certain words and tones of her
lover, her suspicions were strengthened; and, in the interest
of her host, as well as of her country, she instinctively
kept silent, and involuntarily played the spy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” continued Albert, “the outrages of the Unionists
are really beyond belief, though, as yet, I have never
heard of their burning any house except yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still Elfie kept silent. She would let him betray himself
if he wished to do so, but she would say nothing,
not even for the sake of her country, to invite a confidence
which she did not intend to keep. If Albert was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Secessionist, and mistook her for one, and under that mistake
volunteered certain communications, the revelation
of which would be important to the interests of her
country, Elfrida would listen to him, but she would say
nothing to draw him out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did the Unionists burn your house?” indignantly
demanded Albert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The men who burned our house did so because we differed
with them in the matter of States’ rights,” diplomatically
answered Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! of course! that is understood as the remote cause;
but what was the proximate cause, the immediate provocation
to such an outrage?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We raised a flag that was obnoxious to their feelings!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Exactly! In my neighborhood they have torn down
every secession flag that has been raised, and sometimes
tarred and feathered the owners! But I tell you what,
Elfie, their day is nearly over! But you must know that,
living in this house. We can never be sufficiently grateful
to Dr. Rosenthal. His services to the good cause
are so important that I have no doubt he will be rewarded
with a high position in the administration of the
government in the rising young Confederacy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfie listened, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah!” she thought, “he knows that Dr. Rosenthal’s
house is made the rendezvous of revolutionists, and he
believes that Dr. Rosenthal is cognizant of the fact.
Colonel Eastworth could enlighten him on that subject;
but then, Colonel Eastworth is absent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now, Elfie—dear Elfie—knowing what a true-hearted
and brave-spirited little heroine you are, I am
going to tell you something. It is not quite a secret,
Elfie, else I would not confide it even to you. It is known
to all the leaders of our party; it is well known to Eastworth,
and to the gentlemen that visit him; it is known
to your host; and very likely it is known to you also.
If it is, you can speak and save me the trouble of telling
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said Elfie, “I know nothing; I suspect a great
deal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will tell you. Indeed, your sufferings in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>good cause entitle you to the same sort of confidence that
would be given to a man; and your presence in this house
is a sufficient indorsement of your reliability. Besides,
you can be of the greatest use to us. You can be, and I
am sure you will be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would lay down my life if it were required of me in
the good cause,” said Elfie, compressing her lips and
growing deadly white; for in Elfie’s bosom there was a
terrible conflict going on between her love and her loyalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are making great preparations for the pageantry
of the inauguration of their President, Elfie,” he continued,
with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! ha! ha! there will be a pageantry of another sort,
my dear! Do you notice how many Southern men are
quietly sending their women and children out of the
city?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is to get them out of the way of this other pageantry
of which I spoke. My Elfie, Washington is a Southern
city; it belongs to us; and a mere sectional President-elect
will never be permitted to take his seat here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed!” exclaimed Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how can he be prevented from doing so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By force of arms!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By force of arms!” echoed Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Listen; all over Virginia—all over Maryland—there
are bands of devoted and desperate men, organized
and sworn to prevent Lincoln from taking his seat. Our
people in Washington know this, and are ready to cooperate
with us. I bear a captain’s commission in one of
these bands. Colonel Eastworth is my superior officer.
We have three branch and one main rendezvous. And
they are near the bridges crossing the Potomac and the
Anacostia. Our plan is, on or before the fourth of
March, to muster at our several rendezvous, in the darkness
of night; to march at the same time over the three
bridges; to surprise Washington, and so take the city by
assault,” said Albert, warming into enthusiasm with his
narrative.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Oh, Heaven!” muttered Elfie, between her clenched
teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>He heard her mutter something, but failed to catch the
word; and he utterly mistook the cause of her paleness
and sternness of aspect. He was, indeed, absorbed in his
own subject; and so he continued to reveal his plans:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; the streets of Washington may run with blood;
the houses of Washington smoke in ruins; but on the
fourth of March, when Lincoln is expected to take his
seat, the Confederate flag shall wave above the Capitol!”
he exclaimed, rising in his excitement and pacing the
library floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God forbid!” panted Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still he was too absorbed in his own subject to hear her.
After walking up and down the floor a few times, he
came and seated himself by her side, and asked the
question:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is your father, Elfie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He went back to Virginia, a few days ago, to look
after his interests there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When is he expected to return, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not until the inauguration day. He wishes to be
here then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you suppose he knows what is really to take place
before that day?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not suppose he does,” said Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; probably he does not! Certainly he does not! or
he would not have left you here exposed to the coming
danger! Elfie, my darling! you must not be left here!
As soon as I shall have seen Colonel Eastworth, and delivered
the dispatches intrusted to me for him, I shall go
back to Virginia. And, Elfie, my own girl, you must go
with me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had taken her hands in his own, and his face was
beaming with love, and his voice was melting with tenderness
as he spoke to her, and tried to meet her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she withdrew her hand and turned away her face;
she loved him and hated him at the same moment; her
heart was breaking, and she wished for death. But she
never dreamed of flinching from her duty! He continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is no time, my own love, for false delicacy or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>womanish etiquette! I cannot possibly leave you here
exposed to the terrible dangers that are impending over
the city! In revolutions, my Elfie, the innocent are sacrificed
with the guilty! I cannot leave you here, exposed
to the horrors of the coming days! I must make you my
wife; take you with me to Virginia, and leave you under
the protection of my widowed mother! She is alone,
Elfie! She has no other son but myself, and no daughter
at all! She will receive my beloved wife as a dear
daughter, my Elfie! Come! what say you, my own? Do
not avert your head! Let me see your sweet face! Turn
toward me! smile on me. Oh, my Elfie! make me
happy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me!” she exclaimed,
in a passion of indignation, as she started up,
flung off his hand, and walked across the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>This time he heard her, understood her, and gazed upon
her in astonishment, incredulity and agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfrida! is this acting? Or is it real madness? What
do you mean?” he exclaimed, going toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep off!” she said, so shortly, so curtly, so sternly,
that he stopped suddenly, like a man on the brink of a
precipice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me what you mean by this, Elfie!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What I mean by this! I mean to be true to my country!
Next to my duty to God, I rank my duty to my
country! And I will be faithful to her; though my heart
should break in its fidelity?!” passionately exclaimed Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your native State is your country! To her alone is
your allegiance due. She is about to secede from the
Union; and she has a right to do so. And it is your duty
to go with your State!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I deny that a State has any right to secede from the
Union! Set up that doctrine, and see where it would
end!—in the utter dissolution and death of our country;
for if a State has a right to secede from the Union, a
country has the same right to secede from a State; and a
township to secede from a county; and a farm from a
township; and the barn from the farm; and the husband
from the wife, and the child from the father!—and there
you have disintegration and anarchy! Bosh! preach
State’s Rights not to me!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“Elfie!” answered the Secessionist, hotly, “I am willing
to admit your capacity for understanding the construction
of a dress or a dinner; but I doubt your ability
for comprehending the Constitution of the United
States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gammon! The Constitution of the United States is
written in just about the plainest English that I have ever
read, and I claim to understand my mother tongue!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfie, you cannot mean to turn traitor to your native
State!” exclaimed Albert Goldsborough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! I do not mean to turn traitor to my native State,
or native country, or native farm! or to my pap or to my
two unks. In being true to the whole Union, I am true
to every part of the Union, and to every citizen thereof.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Virginia is only nominally in the Union. In a
very few weeks she will be out of it, by the unanimous
voice of her people, heard through their representatives in
the Assembly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fiddle! Virginia go out of the Union by the unanimous
voice of her people, indeed! I am one of her people!
and I would die before I would utter one syllable in
favor of secession! My pap and two unks and a host of
our friends are loyal Virginians who would shed the last
drop of their blood in defense of this glorious Union of
States that makes us one of the mightiest powers among
the nations of the earth! And if Virginia is ever voted
out of the Union, it will never be by the unanimous voice
of her people, or even by the will of the majority of her
people!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you you are mistaken! Virginia and Maryland,
too, will follow the glorious example of their chivalric
sister, South Carolina, who——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Albert Goldsborough, I am not going to stand here all
day long, listening to you; I warn you that Dr. Rosenthal
is loyal to his heart’s core; so loyal that he does not
suspect and could not understand disloyalty in any man!
He is as innocent now as I was an hour ago of the plots
going on under his own roof. If he knew of them he
would denounce them instantly!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! is not Dr. Rosenthal a Secessionist?” demanded
Albert, in consternation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Nor your father, nor your uncles?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfrida, you have played a very treacherous part with
me. You have pretended to be one of us; you have made
false statements in regard to your persecutions in the
cause of secession, and you have drawn out my confidence,
only to turn upon me,” said Albert, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anything more?” inquired Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not that enough?” demanded Albert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but I would like to hear the whole charge before
replying to it. Is that the whole charge?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I deny it <em>in toto</em>. I have played no treacherous
part by you. I never pretended to be one of you. It was
yourself who took it for granted that I must be a Secessionist.
I made no false statements about my persecutions
in the cause of secession. I told you that our house
was burned over our heads, and we had to escape for our
lives. And you jumped to the conclusion that the outrage
was perpetrated by the Unionists of our neighborhood.
I did not seek to draw your confidence out. You
bestowed it upon me freely. If I turn upon you now, it
is as a loyal heart turns upon a rebel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfrida, I won’t stand this!” hotly exclaimed her lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then if you won’t ‘stand’ it, you had better walk it.
Marry you, indeed! Not if I know it. Gammon! If I
were fool enough to marry you this week, why, next
week, or next month you might secede from me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfrida, I will not bear this!” exclaimed Albert,
stamping.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then don’t. There is no reason why you should.
You know the way out of the house into the street, and
you are at liberty to take it. I strongly advise you to do
so,” said Elfrida.</p>

<p class='c007'>He glared at her, and then striding toward her, took
her roughly by the arm, and hissed in her ear:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have become possessed of our secrets. But beware
how you betray them. For if you should, woman
as you are, the vengeance of the Banded Brothers will
surely find you out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bosh!” exclaimed Elfie, “what do you think I care for
the vengeance of the Banded Brothers? I care not for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>them, Albert Goldsborough, even though they may track
and kill me for what I am about to do. The hardest part
of my trial, Albert, you will never know, and perhaps
could never understand!” said Elfie, and she set the
library door wide open, and then went to the corner of the
mantelpiece, and rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that for?” uneasily inquired Albert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is for a servant to show you the way to the front
door, Mr. Goldsborough, since you don’t seem to know it.
Go! I will give you a few hours to get out of the city
and hide yourself. Then I will go to the President and
denounce your plan, that immediate measures may be
taken to defeat it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the President!” sneered Albert Goldsborough, with
a laugh that seemed to say: “Why, he is one of us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I will go to the President and denounce this plot;
and if he won’t listen to me, I will go to General Scott,
and he will save the city. But in the meantime, Albert
Goldsborough, I will give you a few hours to escape in.
I believe there is a train leaves for Baltimore and Philadelphia
in an hour from this; and there is another leaves
for Alexandria and Richmond in an hour and a half.
May the Lord bring you to reason! Go!” she said,
pointing to the open door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Elfrida!” he exclaimed, again advancing toward her.
“If you suppose that I am going to submit to the humiliation
you have put upon me, you are quite mistaken!
I insist——”</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment a servant, summoned by Elfie’s bell,
entered the room, and Albert broke off in his speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go!” said Elfrida, in a low, stern voice, as she still
pointed to the door. “Go! there is no time to be lost,
either by you or me! If you do not obey me at once, I
will summon Dr. Rosenthal and his two brothers, who are
in the house, and have you arrested as you stand!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a young demon!” hissed Albert Goldsborough,
grinding his teeth, as he flung himself out of the
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Attend that gentleman to the door, Catherine; and
then step round to the livery stable and tell them that I
shall want a carriage to be here by two o’clock,” said
Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The girl bowed her head and went out of the room,
closing the door after her.</p>

<p class='c007'>And little Elfie, left alone, paced up and down the
library floor, as a chafed young lioness might pace her
den.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is all over between us now,” she sobbed; “all over
between us forever and ever! And, oh! I did love him!
I did love him so dearly! And with all his faults he did
love me so truly! And he confided all his plans to me
so trustingly. And now I must turn on him and denounce
him and expose him to capture and death! or else
I must hide his secrets in my bosom and let him go on
planning the capture of Washington and the destruction
of the Union. Oh, my goodness! was ever a poor girl in
such a fix as I am!” added Elfie, as she left the library
with the intention of seeking her own room, to prepare
for her visit to the President.</p>

<p class='c007'>For in all the ebbs and flows of contending passions
Elfie was as true to the country as is a politician to his
own interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never can trust myself to tell the story. I should
become agitated and talk slang perhaps, and get myself
and my information discredited. Take the city by assault!
Turn the streets into rivers of blood and the
houses into smoking ruins! Capture the President-elect
and plant the Confederate flag on the dome of the capitol!
Heaven and Earth and the other Place! what a
plot!” exclaimed Elfie, as she sat down to her writing
desk and began to write a short, condensed account of the
plan divulged to her by Albert Goldsborough.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it was finished she put it in a blank envelope,
saying to herself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will not direct it to any particular individual; for if
I do not find one high official dignitary at leisure to see
me I must seek another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she put on her outer garments and sat down to
wait for the carriage she had ordered.</p>

<p class='c007'>It came at the hour, and she went downstairs and took
her place in it. She gave the order to the President’s
house and drove thither.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ah! with what a beating heart she got out of the carriage,
ascended the broad stairs and presented herself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the porter. It was almost a relief to her to be told that
the President could not receive any one that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After all, I doubt if it would have been of any use to
call on him,” said Elfie to herself, as she returned to the
carriage and gave the order:</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the War Department.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at that building, Elfie once more left her carriage,
entered the house and inquired her way to the
office of a certain “high official dignitary,” who must be
nameless in this story.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfie was shown into an ante-room, where she found
herself in company with about half a dozen other persons
of both sexes, who were waiting to see the great man.</p>

<p class='c007'>As she was the last arrival, she had to wait until each
of these had been singly received and dismissed.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last her turn also came, and she was ushered into
the audience chamber of the “high official.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And with grim satisfaction Elfie noticed how his countenance
changed as he read her letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently, with his eyes still following the lines, he
put out his hand, and rang the bell that stood upon his
table.</p>

<p class='c007'>A messenger answered it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he—the “high”—wrote a few lines at the end of
that paper, placed it in another envelope, directed it, and
put it in the hands of the messenger, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take this to its address.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the messenger had bowed low and left the
room, the great man turned to Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have rendered good service, and I thank you for
your zeal. You can withdraw.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br> <span class='c005'>ERMINIE’S GREAT SORROW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Albert Goldsborough was turned out of the
library by his indignant little ladylove, he did not go out
of the house as she had commanded him to do. He
passed cavalierly by the staring and stupefied servant who
had been ordered to attend him, and saying that he should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>go to Colonel Eastworth’s rooms and wait for his return,
ascended the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Catharine slipped after him, opened Colonel Eastworth’s
door, and showed the visitor in. And then,
thinking that she had literally obeyed orders in “attending”
the gentleman, she returned to her duties in the
lower regions of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, Albert Goldsborough threw himself into a
chair before the fire to wait for Colonel Eastworth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three long hours he had to wait. The time hung
heavily on his hands. He read a little from the newspapers
that lay scattered over the table; he walked restlessly,
looking into all the cupboards and out of the windows;
then he sat down at the round table to improve the
time by writing letters that lay heavily on his conscience.
One letter he wrote to his mother, another to some coconspirator
in Virginia, and a third he wrote to Elfie—this
last full of complaining love and tender reproaches.
He was still engaged in writing this letter, which threatened
to be as interminable as love letters usually are, when
the door was suddenly flung open, and Colonel Eastworth
strode into the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You here?” he exclaimed, on seeing his visitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, colonel,” said Albert, rising and hastily rolling
up his love letter and thrusting it into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you brought anything?” he inquired, coming up
to the table, and speaking in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These, colonel,” replied the young man, delivering his
dispatches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth dropped into his chair, tore open the
packet and read the papers, commenting on their contents
as he went on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So,” he murmured, “L. will do nothing until the Legislature
has acted. E. also holds back until the ordinance
of secession is formally passed. J. is waiting for more
light, and making the affair a matter of prayer. But M.,
S. and W. are ready to take the field now, each with
a following of more than a thousand men! Good! I
predict that when Washington is ours, those faint-hearted,
purblind fellows who cannot make up their minds, but
must needs wait for ‘more light,’ will be braced up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>little, and be able to see their duty, or their interest, which,
with such laggards, means the same thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the document was read in silence
and with a lowering brow. Then he drew a quire of
paper before him, took a pen, and rapidly indited a letter,
which he folded, sealed, and put into the hands of the
young man, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry to send you off again in such a hurry,
before you have even had time to rest, Goldsborough;
but it is absolutely necessary that this should be in the
hands of S. before to-morrow morning. There is to be a
meeting at Witch Elms to-morrow evening, and he must
be present; for the final arrangements as to the precise
time and mode of the assault will be discussed and decided
upon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Albert Goldsborough received the packet, but instead
of starting immediately on his mission, he hesitated and
dropped his eyes upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what now? You have something to tell me!”
exclaimed Eastworth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, colonel, I have! You are no longer safe in this
house! A little, prying imp, in the form of a young girl,
has discovered our plot, and means to denounce us to
the authorities and to our host!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The demon! this cannot be true!” exclaimed Colonel
Eastworth, in consternation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is as true as truth, colonel! She has threatened
to denounce us all! And she will surely carry out her
threats!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What girl is this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little Elfrida Fielding!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, the little serpent! And to think that such a little,
insignificant creature should be able to do so much harm!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, colonel! a worm may burrow a hole that shall
sink a ship of the line!” said Albert Goldsborough.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes! Now I must hasten my departure. It is
very fortunate for my plans that old Rosenthal has gone
off to Baltimore to see his brothers thus far on their way
to New York. And that he will not be home until late
to-night. I can leave a letter of adieu to him. But,
Albert, how did this girl manage to discover so much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who can tell?” replied young Goldsborough, evasively,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>for not for the world would he have confessed to
his colonel his own indiscretion in betraying his secrets
to Elfrida before he could be sure of her sentiments on
the subject of secession.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose the little witch has been eavesdropping.
There are too many doors to this apartment to make it a
safe consultation room,” said Colonel Eastworth, moodily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are,” admitted Albert, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, in any case, in a very few days I should be
obliged by expediency to withdraw from the house, and
this discovery has at most but accelerated my action. It
is fortunate that old Rosenthal is out of the way!—Well,
good-day, Albert. I must really send you off at once,”
said Colonel Eastworth, holding out his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I must really go off at once,” agreed young
Goldsborough, respectfully saluting his “superior officer”
as he left the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth, left alone, sank down into his chair
and fell into the moody meditation so frequent with him
of late. Born of an old historical family, whose names
were identified with the chronicles of the country; whose
men were all brave, whose women were all pure; nurtured
in the highest principles of truth and justice; tried
and proved in the legislative halls of his native State and
on the battle plains of Mexico, up to within a few months
past Colonel Eastworth was a man of stainless honor
and glorious fame. But he believed in the absolute sovereignty
of each single State in our Federal Union; in
the absolute right of each State to secede at will from the
Union, and in his own allegiance due solely to his native
State. Thus, warped by the doctrine of States’ Rights
and tempted by the fiend Ambition, he had been won over
to the cause of the Southern Confederacy. Not, however,
without a severe struggle did he win his own consent to
abandon the old flag that had been the idol of his boyish
worship, for which in his bright and blameless youth
he had shed his blood and risked his life, under which he
had gained a nation’s gratitude and a hero’s crown. This
struggle over, all the rest was easy enough—easy as “the
descent to hell” is said to be. The doctrine of States’
Rights admitted, the other doctrines of Expediency naturally
followed as an excuse for all manner of dishonorable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>action. This Expediency led him to lend the powerful
aid of his astute intellect and military experience to the
bands who were planning the capture of the city and the
seizure of the President-elect.</p>

<p class='c007'>After some minutes of moody thought Colonel Eastworth
arose, went downstairs to seek Erminie. He found
her in the drawing-room, toning down the gas which had
just been lighted, and putting those last delicate finishing
touches on the artistic arrangement of the room of which
only the young mistress’ hand seemed capable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am happy to find you alone, sweet love,” he said,
gliding to her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I am very happy to be alone to receive you,”
answered his betrothed, with confiding frankness. “I
love my friends very dearly; but, oh! indeed I am not so
very sorry that the company is gone for the present. We
could not have a word apart while they were here, could
we, Eastworth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sweetest girl, we could not! we could not. And did
you miss our <em>tête-à-têtes</em> so much, mine own?” he asked,
seating himself in a large resting-chair, and drawing her
toward him, much, very much, as a father might draw a
daughter to sit upon his knees.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Lutheran minister’s child was very delicately
shy, and that beautiful shyness was one of her most bewitching
charms. Softly and gently, and without offence,
she evaded his motion, and passed in behind his chair and
bent playfully over him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, yes! I missed our <em>tête-à-têtes</em> so much! I
missed you every day and every hour in the day!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you, my dearest one! did you, indeed, miss me—such
a gray, wrinkled, careworn wretch as I am?” he
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>She bent over him with caressing tenderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was true! Six months before this time there had
not been one silver thread in the raven tresses, or one
line on the ivory forehead of Colonel Eastworth; but now
care had streaked his hair with gray, and the constant
habit of frowning had planted deep wrinkles between his
brows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie leaned over him with caressing tenderness, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>pressed her lips to that spot on the top of his head where
the thin hair indicated swiftly approaching baldness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I love you more for every white hair and every deep
wrinkle; they are indices of thought and of suffering;
and how can I but love you more for them?” murmured
Erminie, laying her soft cheek upon his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come around here, my own! my own! I am your
husband, or soon to be so! Sit where I can see your
sweet face!” he pleaded, reaching behind him and getting
hold of her hand and trying to draw her around.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will sit here and look up into your face—ever the
most beloved face in the universe to me!” murmured
Erminie, softly, as she drew a footstool to his feet and
seated herself upon it, and placed her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie,” he said, bending over her and gazing and
speaking with an earnestness approaching solemnity,
“Erminie, do you really, really love me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked up at him with a frightened aspect, and
answered slowly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you know I do! You cannot doubt me! What
made you ask such a question?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because, my beloved, I am about to put your love to
a terrible test!” he replied, with an agitation that powerfully
appealed to her sympathies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is just what I wish you to do! what I pray you
to do! Put my love to any test—any! so that I may
prove to you how truly I love you—how much I would
do for you!” she answered, in a low, fervent, faltering
voice; and blushing intensely at her own temerity, even
while feeling so anxious to reassure her lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie, the test by which I shall prove your love
will be the severest test by which the love of a nature
like yours could possibly be tried.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will not be too severe for mine! I invoke the trial!
I invoke it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie, do you love me enough to henceforth cast
your lot with mine, for good and evil, for time and
eternity?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, yes, yes, yes! But that is not the test, for surely
every woman loves her betrothed as much as that! But
I love you, oh, so much more!” she murmured, hiding her
face in his caressing hands.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“You love me enough to forsake all and follow me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, yes! Did I not promise that on the blessed
day when my dear father placed my hand in yours in
solemn betrothal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will cleave to me, to me only, forever and ever,
through good report and through evil report?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As my soul lives, I will!” fervently exclaimed the
Lutheran minister’s daughter, uttering the rashest vow
that was ever spoken by trusting lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>She did not even add the saving clause: “In all cases
not inconsistent with my duty.” She did not dream of
doing so. Her pledge to her lover was unconditional
because her faith in him was unbounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor was hers the mere blind faith of a loving heart.
It seemed to be justifiable, for Colonel Eastworth was a
man highly honored by the world, both for his private
character and his public services. How could she ever
imagine that he would call upon her to forsake her father
and her country?</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet this he was about to do. This was the test to which
he meant to put her devoted love. And now he believed
that the time was ripe for the disclosure of his plans.
Now he felt assured that she was truly and unreservedly
his own—so bound to him, body and soul, that she was
not only ready to suffer with him, but willing to sin for
him, if he should wish her to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie,” he said, looking down into her loving,
trustful, fervent face, “Erminie, you have pledged your
faith to me by a very solemn oath—‘As my soul lives.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! And I repeat it. ‘As my soul lives!’ And if
there could be an oath more solemn and binding than
that, without being profane, I would pledge you my faith
by it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie,” he stooped and whispered, “you are already
almost my wife!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes; I consider myself so. With us, you know,
betrothal is as sacred as marriage,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, my beloved, what I wish you to do is to become
my wife in reality and immediately,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But my father, dear Eastworth! My father would
not consent. And besides, he is not here, and will not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>be here until late to-night,” she answered, when at last
she was able to reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my beloved, your father would not consent. It
would be quite useless to ask him even if he were here;
and he is not here. We must act, Erminie, without consulting
your father!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Eastworth, not without my dear father’s consent.
I could not—I could not strike such a blow at my father’s
heart,” she pleaded, plaintively, not as if she could persistently
resist his wishes, but as if she were imploring
him to spare her the trial. He saw that and took an
ungenerous advantage of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do not love me,” he said, coldly and bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had never spoken to her so roughly before. She
looked up at him in surprise and affright.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you do not love me, or you would not answer
me so,” he repeated, with cruel emphasis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I do, I do! Heaven knows how truly and how
much!” she said, clasping her hands in the fervor of her
feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie,” he said, changing his tone from bitter
severity to tender earnestness, “Erminie, I would not ask
you to do this were there not the gravest reasons for it.
Shall I tell you what these reasons are, my beloved girl?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She dropped her head upon her bosom. Her gesture
might have meant assent or despondency. He took it as
an assent and he continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie, I am obliged to leave, not only this house,
but this city, to-night—to leave, not only in haste, but
in danger!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In danger!” she echoed, growing very pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, in danger—and as a fugitive!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As a fugitive! Oh, Heaven of Heavens! what has
happened?” she gasped, in deadly terror for his safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been betrayed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Betrayed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do nothing but echo my words, sweet love!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, forgive me! How can I help it? They are so
strange and so alarming—your words. And I am all in
a maze of bewilderment,” she faltered, trembling
excessively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you not surmise what all this means, Erminie?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Oh, no, no, no! I dare not—I dare not! I only know
whatever the mystery is, you are blameless in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, sweet love, for your boundless faith. But
I am something higher and better than blameless, my
Erminie, or I should not deserve your faith and love. I
go out of this city in haste, in danger, and as a fugitive;
but I return to it, Erminie, at the head of an army,
with beating drums and waving banners!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She gazed at him in amazement. His words were as
unintelligible to her as if he had spoken in Sanscrit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now do you understand?” he inquired, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reassured by his manner, she also smiled, as she shook
her head and replied:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand that my betrothed husband is all that is
good, noble, honorable; but I do not understand his
words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My beloved Erminie, listen: I am a Secessionist! One
of the leaders in this second coming war of independence,
which is to be more glorious than the first; one of the
builders of this second young republic, whose splendor
is destined to eclipse the first! And when I ask you to
go away with me to-night, it is to share the fate of one
who would lift you up beside him to, perhaps, the highest
position in the gift of the young Confederacy!—Why,
what is the matter with you, love?” he suddenly broke
off and inquired, as she turned from him and dropped
her head upon her bosom. “What is the matter with you,
Erminie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My heart is broken!” she murmured, in an almost
dying voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense, my darling girl! I know what your professed
principles are. I often hear you express yourself
strongly in favor of this absurd ‘Union.’ But I also
know that, daughter-like, you take your opinions from
your father, and, parrot-like, repeat the words he uses,
without attaching much meaning to them. Henceforth,
Erminie, you must take your opinions, not from your
father, but from your husband. What do you say, my
love?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think that I took those opinions from my
father. I do not remember the time when I did not
know that treason——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“Erminie!” he exclaimed, in a voice so stern as to make
her start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, pardon me,” she said. “I did not mean to speak
so rudely. And I did not wish to offend you. And oh!
perhaps I misunderstood you. Heaven grant that I may
have done so. Oh, indeed, I must have done so! I am
so stupid and bewildered. You are true to your country,
are you not? Oh, tell me that you are, and I will ask
your pardon on my knees for my momentary doubt of
you!” she pleaded, clasping her hands, and gazing at
him with imploring eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Erminie, I am true to my country; but not in
the sense, I fear, you mean. I am true to my country.
I am pledged for the support of the Southern Confederacy,
which is the only country I acknowledge!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, oh, my heart! all is over between us!” she
cried, sinking down at his feet, utterly overwhelmed by
this blow he had dealt her.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stooped and raised her tenderly, and drew her to
his bosom, murmuring:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie, my love, my love!”</p>

<p class='c007'>She turned suddenly and threw her arms around his
neck and clasped him tightly, as though she would have
held him with all her girl’s strength back from the Malebolge
of ruin into which he was about to plunge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Eastworth, I would give my life to find you indeed
right! I would rather be wrong a thousand times
than you should be wrong once! But I see this all too
clearly to deceive myself. I have loved this Union so
much! I have thought of her as the Promised Land,
the New Jerusalem, the refuge of all the oppressed, the
hope of the world! And would you aim a deathblow at
her? Oh, think how weak she would be if broken up and
divided! Think how the old despotic monarchies of the
East would rejoice over her downfall, which would prove
self-government a failure among nations. Oh, my dearest,
let me hold you back! I would give my life—almost
my soul—to save you from this vortex!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie, love, you speak from prejudice and from
feeling, and not from reason and judgment. Dear love,
I will not reproach you, though you have called my devotion
to my native State and her confederates treason,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>but I will say that when a man is charged with treason
he has the right to defend himself. Will you hear my
defence?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eastworth, if I have said anything offensive to you, I
do earnestly beg your forgiveness. But I did not mean
to offend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you hear my defence?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, yes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Eastworth began to plead the cause of Secession
with all the arguments by which astute leaders
influence the opinions of people. These arguments are
too familiar to all to need repetition here. But they made
no impression on the mind of Erminie Rosenthal. She
was not to be deceived by sophistry or persuaded by eloquence,
or even won over by love. “Her eye was single,
and her whole soul was full of light.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hour after hour slipped away while he argued, persuaded
and implored Erminie to unite her fate with his
own, and accompany him to Virginia. And Erminie
suffered, wept, but remained steadfast to her principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, as the time approached for his departure
and found her unmoved, he became angry, and gave way
to cruel reproaches.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have deceived me, Miss Rosenthal. You have
played the part of a heartless coquette. You do not love
me and you have never done so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Eastworth, I love you more than life! Heaven
truly knows I do!” she said, through her sobs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Words, words, words! You can talk of love glibly
enough. No doubt you could write what school misses
would call ‘sweet verses’ on the theme; but you cannot
feel it, Erminie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Eastworth, I would sacrifice my life to save you
if I could. Heaven truly knows that I would!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Words, words, words again! All that is easily said.
You would sacrifice your life to save me. It is very safe
to promise that, since no such sacrifice can possibly be
required of you. You will sacrifice your life, which nobody
asks you to do, but you will not go with me when I
leave this place a fugitive—you will not go with me,
though I implore you to do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“It is because it would be wrong for me to do so, and
I dare not do wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Words, words, words!” he said again, with bitter
scorn. “Farewell, Miss Rosenthal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And he got up and strode toward the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quick as light she flew before him, intercepted him
and clasped him in her arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t—don’t go! Spare yourself! Oh, Eastworth!
oh, my love, spare yourself!” she cried, almost
beside herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you go with me?” he stooped and whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, never! I dare not do wrong!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then let me go alone, false-hearted girl!” he cried,
tearing off her clasping arms and flinging her from him
with such force that she fell upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>He rushed up into his room, rang for his servant, sent
out and ordered a carriage, and while waiting for it
hastily packed up his most valuable effects, and as soon
as it came to the door he entered it and drove to the
station in time to catch the train for Alexandria and
Orange.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some minutes after the carriage had rolled away, Elfrida
chanced to come down to the drawing-room, and
there she found Erminie lying upon the floor in a
swoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In great alarm she rang for assistance, and then flew
to the side of her friend and raised her up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie opened her eyes, and, recognizing Elfrida,
burst into tears and sobbed passionately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t cry—they are not worth tears,” said Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Elfrida! oh, Elfrida! If you knew—if you
knew!” sobbed Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know all about it. I saw Colonel Eastworth drive
away in a cab, with all his luggage packed in and around
it. And I know that your lover has gone to help my
lover to plot against the safety of the city. But, thank
goodness, I have been beforehand with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment Catharine opened the door and came
in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you ring, miss?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—more coal,” said Elfie, with great presence of
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>And when the girl had gone, Elfie whispered to her
friend:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep a stiff upper lip; never say die; don’t let the
servants see us fret.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must not let my dear father see me grieve. To prevent
that must be my first care. But if it were not for
him I should pray—oh, I should pray for death!” sobbed
Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t see it in that light at all! Long life to all true
patriots, both men and women, because, you see, the
country needs them all! And now, Minie, you are hardly
able to stand. Do let me help you up into your room
before that sharp-eyed girl comes back,” said Elfie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie yielded, and Elfie took her upstairs and persuaded
her to lie down on her bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, the governor will not be home until the late
train gets in; that will not be until eleven o’clock to-night.
I will sit up for him and have his oysters and lager beer
ready for him; and I will tell him that you are very tired
and have gone to bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, dear Elfie! And by to-morrow morning I
hope to be able to meet my father with some composure,”
said Erminie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now what else can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing, dear girl, but to leave me alone with God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfrida stooped over her and kissed her, and then
softly left the room and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>The six o’clock dinner that was prepared that day
went away from the table untasted. There was no one
to partake of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfie sent out and got some fresh oysters and lager
beer for her kind host, and had a neat little table set in the
library ready for him when he should come home.</p>

<p class='c007'>He came in at eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfie opened the library door and drew him in there,
and helped him off with his wrappings and with his overcoat,
and placed the easy-chair near the fire, and brought
him his bootjack and slippers, and performed all the affectionate
little services that Erminie was accustomed to
render her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is my Minie?” inquired the old man, extending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>his hands over the warm fire, when he had made
himself comfortable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone to bed very tired, leaving me to be your daughter
for this once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And a nice little daughter you are, my dear. I wish
Justin had taken a fancy to you instead of to that Tammany
Hall reformer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So do I! But he hadn’t the good taste to do so,
you see,” said Elfie, saucily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And my Minie was tired. No wonder, poor dear!
She has had a great many cares lately, with so much
company staying in the house. I am not alluding to you,
my dear, for you are a help and a Godsend! And Eastworth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he has retired too (from the establishment),”
added Elfie, in a mental reservation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, yes, well. I must have some supper now, my
dear, since you are my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfie rang, and supper was served; and then the old
man and the young girl separated and retired to their
respective rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>And dear, unselfish Elfie, now that her fortitude could
be of use to no one under the sun, broke down and wept
all night, soaking her pillow with her tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the morning, when Dr. Rosenthal came downstairs,
the first thing that met him was a letter that Colonel
Eastworth had left in charge of Catherine to be delivered
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his unbounded astonishment, that letter revealed to
him that his late guest and promised son-in-law was
pledged to the support of the Southern Confederacy and
had gone away to enter upon his new service.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven have mercy on my poor child!” was the first
thought of the father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie came down to breakfast as pale as death and
almost as still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see that you know all, my dearest child,” said the
old man as soon as he saw her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my father, pray for him—pray that he may be
led back to us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will, my Minie!—I will, my angel child! God
bless you!” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Erminie seated herself at the head of the table, and
went through the duties of the breakfast service quietly;
and after breakfast she went about her household affairs
as usual. Later in the day Elfrida communicated to Dr.
Rosenthal Albert Goldsborough’s visit and revelation to
herself, and also her own visit to the War Department
and its results.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, ha! that was what hurried Eastworth away.
But for Erminie’s sake I will not call him ill names, however
well he may deserve them. Heavens! to think I
should have been so blind!” said the old man, whose
astonishment at the conduct of his late guest increased
with every hour of thought upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of that day a rumor spread through the
city which created a great excitement. It was to the
effect that the War Department had received certain information
of a large and well organized plot to seize the
capital and prevent the inauguration of the President-elect.</p>

<p class='c007'>And everywhere citizens were enrolling themselves in
military companies for the defence of Washington; and
among the first names that went down upon that immortal
roll was the name of Ernest Rosenthal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br> <span class='c005'>ON THE DESERT ISLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While the stormclouds of civil war, charged with destruction,
lowered darkly over our dear native land, all
was benign repose on the Desert Island where our young
pair had been cast away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wreck of their ship still lay high and dry upon
the rocks where she had struck. So fast was her position,
with her keel impaled upon the sharp hornlike points
of the rocks, that neither winds nor waves had as yet
power to break her up or lift her off. It seemed as if she
must remain there until she should gradually perish and
go to pieces by the drying and warping of her timbers
in the blazing sunshine. This state of affairs continued
for many months.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Every day during this period Justin, Britomarte and
Judith passed over the reef of rocks from the island to
the wreck, and fed the animals there and brought away
as many of the stores as they could carry. But as the
way was long and the work toilsome, and as twice in the
twenty-four hours the reef of rocks was covered with
water, it was impossible for them to make more than one
trip a day; and it took them a long time to remove all
the stores; a time of much anxiety it was, for they
were in constant expectation of some terrible gale that
should break up the wreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, after many weeks of labor, they had brought
away from the wreck everything that could possibly be
of use to them on their desert island, and this, of course,
included all the real necessaries of life, and stores of
provisions enough to last them for years. All these
things were carefully stowed away in the caves and
grottoes of which their mountain was full.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not until all the stores were secured that Justin
proposed to bring away the animals, for they had been
best off on the wreck so long as there was anything there
for them to eat, and therefore they had been left there to
the last. It was a work of difficulty, almost amounting
to impossibility, to get these beasts over the causeway;
but finally the task was safely accomplished and the
castaways settled down to a monotonous existence on the
lonely isle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the spring Justin commenced building; but on account
of rough material and imperfect tools, and for the
lack of help, the work progressed very slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus more than a year passed since they were first cast
upon the Desert Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had given up all expectation that any roving ship
should come near enough their isle to discover the signal
flag that they always kept flying from the summit of the
mountain, though every day Justin paid a visit of ceremony
to that flag and took a look out at sea through his
telescope.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearly two years had passed, and no incident worth
recording had happened, when one night their island was
visited by a most tremendous hurricane. It raged all
night, and only subsided in the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>At midday, when all was over, Justin, Britomarte and
Judith walked up to the top of the mountain to see what
had become of the wreck that had remained there for
twenty months, high and fast upon the rocks, and perishing
slowly by the dry rot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin arranged the telescope and took a sight. And
what did he see?</p>

<p class='c007'>Not the wreck! for the last vestige of the wreck was
broken up and carried away by the winds and waves in
the last night’s tempest.</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw a sail, a strange sail, with a strange flag, bearing
down upon the island.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXV.<br> <span class='c005'>A STRANGE SAIL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What is it, Justin? Oh, dear brother, what is it?”
eagerly inquired Miss Conyers, almost losing her presence
of mind in the vehemence of her anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a sail—a strange sail! Compose yourself, dear
Britomarte,” answered Mr. Rosenthal, without removing
his eye from the glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A sail!” she repeated, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, dear!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Justin!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It stands in toward the island.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She sees our signal!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I think not, unless the captain’s glass is better
than mine; for with mine I cannot make out her colors
yet, and our signal is no more conspicuous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you sure she is coming in here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why, unless she sees our signal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has been driven out of her course by the gale of
yesterday; but probably she has safely outridden the
storm. She may be coming hither in search of fresh
water or wood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Justin, if she should strike that sunken reef of
rocks as our poor ship did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She will not do so, dear! She is steering clear of
the rocks and for that little cove to leeward of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Oh! Justin, Justin, then she will surely anchor there.
And we—we shall be rescued! Oh! we shall see our
fellow-beings and our native land again! The thought
makes me reel with joy and—suspense!” exclaimed Miss
Conyers, really growing dizzy with emotion, and clasping
the flagstaff for support.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear sister, calm yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! how can I? Our case seemed so hopeless! and
now the thought that we shall be rescued and taken back
to our native country overwhelms me! Oh, to leave
this! to go home! it is like bursting the bonds of the
grave, and rising from death to life! To go home!—to
go home! Oh, Justin, does she draw near? Are you
sure that she does not turn her head to steer away
again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At what rate does she seem to sail? Is she making
rapid progress?” persisted Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is making very rapid progress, though I cannot
tell you at how many knots an hour she is sailing.
There! I can see her colors now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can! What are they? English? Dutch?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think they are our own Stars and Stripes—the most
beautiful national colors that fly!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Justin—Oh, Justin! Our own dear Star-Spangled
Banner! That would be too much joy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think it is our flag. I am not sure, because I cannot
yet see very distinctly. I think it is, because I see
the red and the white; but I cannot make out the blue
field with the white stars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That would not be so conspicuous against a background
of blue white and white foam; but you will see
the whole presently,” said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin continued to gaze through his telescope at the
stranger for a few minutes longer, and then he spoke:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Justin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are not the Stars and Stripes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Justin! I am so sorry! But then we ought to
be glad and grateful for any flag that should come to
our rescue. What is it, then, Justin? The Union Jack;
that would be the next best thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“No; it is not the Union Jack.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, then? Can’t you speak and tell us, dear
Justin?” said Britomarte, a little impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The truth is that I myself don’t know! I thought I
was familiar with the colors of all nations, but I cannot
make these out at all!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How strange. What are they like?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like bars—red, white and red. I do not recollect
them as the colors of any nation on the face of the
earth!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense! You have forgotten! Let me look, Justin.
I am familiar with the flags of all nations,” said
Britomarte, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>He adjusted the telescope for her sight, and she took a
long and silent view.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you make of the flag?” inquired Justin,
with good-humored sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Red—white—red! I can make nothing of it whatever.
I never saw it before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judith, you are an old salt, and have seen many a
strange flag in the ports where you have stopped in your
voyages to and from India. Take a look at this one, and
tell us if you ever saw it before,” said Justin, as Britomarte
retired from the telescope.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure and so I will. Faix, if it was the flag iv purgatory
itself, with Ould Nick at the helm, I’d be glad to
hail it, so I would, if it would take us offen this baste
iv an island,” said Judith, taking her place at the telescope
and “sighting” the object.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, can you make the flag out?” inquired Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Devil a bit. I niver saw the likes iv it before in all
the days iv me life. Sure and I’m thinking it must be
a pirate or a fraybooter,” said Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may be right, Judith! though Heaven forbid
you should be!” answered Mr. Rosenthal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin!” exclaimed Britomarte, who now replaced
Judith at the glass—“Justin, she must be a pirate! She
carries guns! I see them!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know she carries guns; but it does not follow from
that circumstance that she is a pirate. She may be an
armed merchantman.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“Sailing under no recognized flag, Justin? Would
not an armed merchantman sail under the colors of her
country?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Most likely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if this should be a pirate!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, if she should! The contingency is not a pleasant
one. Judith, we must go down the mountain, my
good girl, and hide all the animals in the holes of the
rocks; for, if this strange sail should prove to be a pirate
coming here in search of wood and water, she would
be sure to make very free with all our stores, and especially
with the beasts!” said Justin, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Troth would she! And sure if the crew was hungry
for fresh beef itself, they’d kill and ate Crummie, the
crayture in less time nor I could milk her, so they
would!” said the Irish girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, let us go!” urged Justin, taking up his telescope.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three turned their steps down the mountain side,
and employed the next hour in driving the animals into
the caverns at the base of the mountain; and closing up
the openings to these caverns, not with boards—which
would have attracted attention—but with green brushwood,
arranged in such a way as to seem a part of the
natural thicket that clothed the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this was done, they went to Britomarte’s grotto,
and concealed as many of the most valuable articles there
as they could find a hiding place for.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they walked down to the beach in the direction
from which they expected to see the strange ship. They
had no need to use their telescope now. As soon as they
reached the sands they saw the ship at anchor in the little
cove, while from her masthead flew the strange flag.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they gazed, a boat put off from the ship and
rowed rapidly toward the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>In ten minutes it touched the sands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The six oarsmen laid on their oars; and the one officer,
in a uniform as strange as his flag, stood up in the bows
and lifted his hat in courteous salutation to the islanders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had not expected to find civilized people in this outlandish
place,” he said, in English, to Justin, who came
forward to meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“You are welcome,” said Justin, offering his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had no idea that there was a European colony
here! What is it—English?” inquired the stranger,
stepping on the shore, and again lifting his hat and bowing
politely to the women.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no colony. We are not colonists. We were
cast away on this island nearly two years ago,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cast away!” echoed the stranger, recoiling in dismay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. We were passengers in the East Indiaman,
<em>Sultana</em>, bound from Boston to Calcutta, and which was
wrecked upon these rocks below.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so that was the fate of the missing <em>Sultana</em>!”
said the stranger, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was her fate,” repeated Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were any of her crew or passengers saved besides
yourselves?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We cannot tell! They took to the lifeboats! The
first boat that left the ship sailed for the open sea, and
we never heard of her fate. The second one attempted
to reach the land, and was swamped. This lady and
her companion were in that second boat when it went
down. They were saved by means of the life-preservers
that had been fastened round their waists. They were
thrown on shore by the waves. The remainder of their
boat’s crew perished, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The captain and myself were left on the wreck. The
captain was washed overboard by a great wave. I escaped
only by clinging fast to the shrouds of the mizzen mast,
which was above water. When the sea went
down, I managed to reach the shore over that reef of
rocks, at the end of which our ship had struck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And where our ship had very nearly been lost in the
late tempest! You have been here nearly two years, you
say. Good Heavens! how have you subsisted?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Partly by the natural productions of the island,” said
Justin, evasively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how have you got on with the natives?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are no natives except beasts, birds, reptiles and
insects.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the island is uninhabited?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“By man? Yes, except ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you have been here nearly two years. Heavens!
And in all that time seen no ship from home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No ship from anywhere! I think this island is out of
the usual course of ships.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we were driven far out of our course, and clean
out of our reckoning, before we saw it! Two years!
And yet the dress of the young lady and her attendant is
just as neat as though fresh from the hand of the laundress,”
said the stranger, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We managed to save a few necessaries from the
wreck, and clothing, soap, starch, and flatirons were
among them,” Justin explained with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! nearly two years on this desert island, without
news of the world outside! Without telegrams, letters,
or newspapers! How, in Heaven’s name, have you
managed to endure life?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indifferently well! Do we look as though we suffered
from ill health, or low spirits?” inquired Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, that you don’t! But your Eden has an Eve!
Oh! that the desert were my dwelling place, with one
fair spirit for my minister! You have two! Happy
man! The <em>Sea Scourge</em> has not one!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The <em>Sea Scourge</em>,” echoed Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My ship out there, of which I am the captain, at your
service!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin bowed and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name is Rosenthal. If you will give me yours I
will present you to the lady.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My name is Spear, for want of a better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Conyers,” said Justin, stepping a few paces towards
Britomarte, “Captain Spear, of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Spear bowed very low. Miss Conyers bent
slightly and then looked up, to see before her a tall,
broad-shouldered, stalwart man, of about forty years of
age, with prominent features, red hair and beard, and
sun-burnt complexion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the young woman with the damask-rose cheeks?”
inquired the captain, indicating the Irish girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her name is Judith Riordan. She is Miss Conyers’
attendant,” said Justin, coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding which, Captain Spear turned, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>honored the maid with a deep bow as he had bestowed
upon the mistress, and a bold stare of admiration into the
bargain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith turned away, hugely affronted, growling:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bedad ye nadent be thrying to come yer comether
over the likes if me, so ye nadent! Mesself don’t like the
looks iv ye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Spear turned with a smile to Miss Conyers,
saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you do not share your companion’s antipathy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I did,” said Miss Conyers, “I should not show it to
a stranger who comes among us, perhaps seeking relief
for his own necessities; perhaps to rescue us from our
exile.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain bowed, and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr.—Rosenfeldt—is not that the name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rosenthal,” corrected Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Rosenthal tells me that you have been on this
lone island nearly two years; and in all this time have had
no news of your native land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is quite true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must have suffered intense anxiety.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I left no near relatives in my native land to
mourn for me. I had one or two school friends; but
they were too happily situated and too well cared for
long to lament my unknown fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you, Mr.—Rosenthal—am I right?” said the
captain, turning to Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord kape yer!” impatiently interrupted Judith—“hev
ye got no mimory at all, at all? or are ye afther dhrinking
itself, that ye can’t remimber a gintleman’s name,
when yer afther hearing it so often! It’s Rosenthal, sure—thal,
thal, thal! There! twist that round yer tongue,
and lave off staring at me as if ye’d ate me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain of the <em>Sea Scourge</em> laughed, and once more
turned to Justin, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Rosenthal, how have you borne this long separation
from home and friends, and this utter lack of news
from the world outside, for nearly two years?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I hinted before, neither my health nor spirits have
suffered materially. I left a venerated father and a beloved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>sister and many friends. I know that my father
and sister have mourned me as dead; and that they continue
to remember me with affection; but I also know
that religion and time have combined to soothe their sorrows
and regrets. As for the world from which I am
separated, I feel that the Lord took very good care of it
before I was born into it, and can continue to take very
good care of it now that I am exiled from it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Rosenthal, you are a philosopher.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nevertheless, I shall be very glad to get back, with
my companions in misfortune, to our native country,”
said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it will confer upon myself more happiness than
I ever received in my life to take you all back,” said the
captain, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks! I can well believe it,” replied Justin,
warmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Troth, maybe he’s not so bad as he looks,” muttered
Judith to herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte studied him with more attention than before.
It was strange, but he impressed the islanders in
opposite ways; for while his appearance excited suspicion,
his manners inspired confidence—except, perhaps, in the
single instance of his bold stare at poor Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you——” began Justin, but before proceeding
with his sentence he went up to Britomarte and spoke
apart to her, asking her permission to invite these
strangers to the grotto. She gave it readily; and then
Justin stepped back to Captain Spear and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you do us the honor to come up to our home
and take lunch?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks—willingly. I should like to see what sort of
a home you have contrived to provide on this Desert
Isle,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And your boat’s crew? Can they not leave their boat
to accompany us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By no means! I will not so far trespass on your
kindness or the young lady’s forbearance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh!” said Britomarte, earnestly, “believe me that
neither Mr. Rosenthal nor myself would consider it a
trespass. It has been so long, so long, since we have
seen any other human faces than our own, that we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>more than delighted to welcome you and your whole
crew.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, young lady. With your kind permission,
then, I will call the men off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, the captain walked a few paces toward the
boat, and called:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, Mulligan! Secure the boat, and you and your
mates come off and follow us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he came back to where Justin and Britomarte
stood, and said that he was ready to accompany them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br> <span class='c005'>THE CAPTAIN OF THE SEA SCOURGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They walked on through a grove of palms, and then
through a thicket that clothed the base of the mountain,
until they reached the front of Britomarte’s grotto.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see it is to no house that we are able to invite
you, captain, but we will make you very heartily welcome
to this ‘hole in the wall’ of the mountain,” said Justin,
smiling, as he opened the door, and drew aside the curtain
that concealed the entrance to Britomarte’s grotto.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A palace for Pan and the wood nymphs, upon my
soul!” said the captain, in sincere admiration, as he followed
Justin and Britomarte into the grotto, and looked
around upon its glistening white walls and brilliant skylight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We like it very much,” said Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like it! Who would dwell in houses made with
hands, when they might live in a fairy grotto like this?”
exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin drew one of the armchairs forward, and invited
him to take it.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Judith removed the woolen table cover, and replaced
it with a damask tablecloth, preparatory to spreading
the lunch.</p>

<p class='c007'>As plates, dishes, glasses, castors, knives, forks and
spoons were in turn placed upon the table, the captain of
the <em>Sea Scourge</em> looked on with ever-increasing amazement.
Turning his eyes from the well-appointed table to
the comfortably-furnished grotto, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“It appears to me that you saved a great deal from the
wreck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Justin, cautiously, for he could not as yet
feel full confidence in his guest; “yes, the ship was cast
very high upon the rocks, and when the sea went down
she was almost entirely out of the water, and we saved
at least enough furniture from the cabins and dining-saloons
to fit up this grotto comfortably. The crockery
in the dining-saloon suffered most in the storm, for out
of a mountain of broken glass and earthenware, we rescued
only a dozen or so of whole pieces; and indeed the
whole pieces are not entirely whole, for there is scarcely
one that is not cracked or chipped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been a stupendous labor for one man to
get all these things, especially this heavy furniture, from
the wrecked ship to the shore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was the labor of months,” answered Justin, “but I
did not accomplish it alone. Miss Conyers brought all
the light articles over, and Judith Riordan, who is a
model of strength, assisted me to bring the heavy ones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While the two men conversed, Judith, under the direction
of Britomarte, spread the table with a cold ham,
a chicken pie, a loaf of bread, cheese, and a bottle of
brandy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brandy, too!” exclaimed the captain of the <em>Sea
Scourge</em>, on beholding this last welcome addition to the
feast. “Brandy, too! you are very fortunate, as well as
industrious. You must have saved a lot of it, to have
lasted you nearly two years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay,” said Justin, evasively, “we saved some bottles,
but as we kept it in case of illness, and never required its
use in that contingency, the store could not give out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I assure you, if I were going to leave you a settled
colonist upon this Desert Isle, I would not touch a
drop of your brandy, but as I hope to take you all with
me when I sail, I will gladly drink it to your health and
happiness,” said the captain of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, suiting
the action to the word by helping himself liberally to the
brandy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure if he’s not a fraybooter itself, it’s fray and aisy
he is entirely,” muttered Judith, as she passed Miss
Conyers on her way to the kitchen. Britomarte smiled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>and Judith presently reappeared with a pitcher of water,
which she also set upon the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now, all being ready, Justin invited his guest to
seat himself at the board.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But where are the men whom you ordered to follow
you, captain?” inquired the host.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, they are straggling in, I suppose. They will be
here presently, doubtless. But, my young friend, pray
don’t waste this brandy on them, whatever you do. It is
genuine old Otard, such as you cannot buy for love or
money in the States, though you may pay highly for a
lot of drugged Yankee rum that sells under its honored
name. Besides, my fellows wouldn’t appreciate it, and
it is desecration of good liquor to give it to men who
don’t know it when they taste it. Give them the cheapest
whisky that you may happen to have to throw away,”
said the captain, filling for himself another glass, which
he held up to the light with the glance of a connoisseur.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, I think I am no better judge of liquors than
the most ignorant of your men. We have a small cask
of whisky, and your men are welcome to it, though
whether it is good, bad or indifferent, I cannot tell,” said
Justin, who was busy in cutting up the chicken pie, with
which he liberally helped his guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Chicken, by all that’s gracious! Did you save chickens
enough to stock your poultry yards, my friend?” inquired
the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We saved a few, from which we raised other broods,”
answered Justin, rather reservedly, for it did not escape
his notice that while Captain Spear put his host through
a rather close cross-examination, he was not at all communicative
on his own affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>And neither had Justin lost sight of the mystery of the
strange flag, but with something of the old Bedouin sentiment
of hospitality, which permits the guest, whoever he
may be, to come and go unquestioned, Justin forbore to
make inquiries, at least for the present. He hoped that
the captain himself would soon volunteer information.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this he was disappointed. The captain ate heartily
of the chicken pie, and passed from that to the ham, and
from the ham to the cheese, washing down the whole
with abundant draughts of old brandy, which seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>take no more effect on him as yet than so much pure
water.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last, when the stranger had eaten enough and was
satisfied, and Judith had taken out the remnants of the
feast, and divided them among the men who were sitting
grouped outside the grotto door, Justin thought the time
had come when, without impropriety, he might question
his guest. He began in a delicate, distant, roundabout
manner, on the common ground of politics.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I need not ask you if you are a native American, Captain
Spear. I see that you are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—I am. And yourself? Your name is German;
yet you speak English like a native.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am a native American of German descent,” answered
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A native American, are you?—of the North, or the
South?” inquired the stranger, pointedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of the South,” replied Justin, rather reservedly, and
feeling that the tables were being turned upon him, and
that from the questioner he was again becoming the
questioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of the South! So am I. Give me your hand again.
We shall be friends, I am sure!” warmly exclaimed the
red-bearded captain, seizing the fist of his host and shaking
it heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks,” said Justin, wincing somewhat. Then,
making another effort to enter upon the common ground
of politics, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I left my native country last October a year ago,
the contest was very bitter between the two great parties
that divided the nation. Which succeeded in electing
their candidate?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Heavens! What a realizing sense of your long
sequestration from the world and your utter ignorance
of its affairs your question gives me! I positively never
fully appreciated your position until this moment! Man,
you might as well have been dead and buried in your
grave as entombed alive in this desert of an island!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think so,” said Justin. “But tell me who
was elected President of the United States?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it possible that you don’t know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How should I? I left the United States in October.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>When I left there seemed to be an equal chance of success
between the candidates; the election did not come off
until November.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you don’t know what has happened since?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! did no passing ship bring you the news?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If a ship had passed, we should not have been found
here,” said Justin, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did no bird sing it? No wave bear it? No breeze
waft it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Birds, waves and breezes are not apt to gossip with
me,” replied Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hear it, Olympian Jove! Here is a gallant son of
the South that does not yet know that he is free! That
he has been free for nearly two years! A man that still
believes in the supremacy of the Stars and Stripes and in
the existence of the Glorious Union! Ha—ha—ha! ho—ho—ho!
Oh! but in respect to the ladys’ presence, I
could shout with laughter! Come—what will you give
me for my news?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, friend, if you will not freely impart your news
to an exile who has been without any for so long a time,
I have nothing to offer you but my thanks,” replied Justin,
greatly perplexed by the words and manners of his
guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now that appeals to my better nature! I will tell
you all. But stay—I must not tell you all at once. It
would overwhelm you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In Heaven’s name, what has happened? Have we
annexed Canada, or Mexico, or both?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither yet—I tell you I must break the matter to
you gently. And first by answering your question as to
who was elected President of the United States. And I
will do it dramatically as well as gradually. Behold, the
curtain rises on the grand drama. Act 1st, Scene 1st.—The
Election of Abraham Lincoln!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven!” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say so too! We Southerners worked hard for the
election of Old Abe; because we knew if he was not
elected we could never carry our point with the common
people against their superstitious attachment to the
Union.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“What do you mean? I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; perhaps not, for that was one of the deepest
dodges of state-craft that ever was tried. The slave-power
working covertly for the election of the abolition
candidate! Ha—ha—ha! Ho—ho—ho!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on—perhaps I shall know what you would be at
presently,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you will. Shift the scene. Scene 2nd.—The
Secession of South Carolina!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What!” thundered Justin, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir!” replied the captain of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>,
who understood only the astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“South Carolina seceded?” repeated Justin, now in incredulous
amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Glorious little State! Yes! She alone first flung
down the gauntlet of defiance! She, single handed, challenged
the whole power of the Federal Government and
inaugurated the second great War of Independence!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What followed?” demanded Justin, in a low voice;
while Britomarte, leaning her elbow on the table and
bending forward, listened breathlessly to the next words
of the stranger. “Wait and see! Shift the scenes.
Scene 3d. This is a very exciting scene. Secession of
Georgia, followed by the secession of all the Gulf States!
Retirement of the Southern Senators from the Senate of
the United States!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And were they suffered to depart?” inquired Britomarte,
in a soft but thrilling voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course they were, young lady! What should hinder
them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their arrest, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha—ha—ha! Ho—ho—ho! Catch Uncle Jemmy at
that game! or any of his Cabinet either! But let me go
on with the play. Scene 4th. A very stately scene this—the
Confederate Congress at Montgomery! Organization
of a provisional government! Election of Jefferson
Davis as President of the Southern Confederacy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” exclaimed Justin, starting up in almost uncontrollable
agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I tell you! Now sit down and be quiet! Don’t
let your feelings overcome you prematurely. For there
are more news and greater scenes to come! I see I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>right to break the glory on <a id='t201'></a>you gradually—as the day
dawns. No one could bear the light of the sun if it
started up suddenly in the blackness of the night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going on. Scene 5th. A very comic scene this.
Executive mansion. Emissaries of the Confederacy inviting
President Jemmy to withdraw United States
troops from Fort Sumter. Emissaries from Major Anderson
beseeching President Jemmy to reinforce United
States troops at Fort Sumter. President Jemmy standing
hesitating between two opinions, like the donkey between
two bundles of hay—doesn’t know what to do, and
does nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The man must have been in his dotage!” exclaimed
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Probably! We didn’t object to that! But let us proceed
with the play. Scene 6th. A splendid spectacular
scene this—embracing the whole depth of the stage, the
full force of the company, brilliant fireworks, <em>et cetera</em>.
In short—The bombardment of Fort Sumter! The fall
of Fort Sumter! Lowering of the Star-Spangled Banner.
Elevation of the Confederate Flag! Grand Tableau!
And the curtain falls upon the first act of the
great drama amidst thunders of applause.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin had sprung to his feet, and was standing gazing
with starting eyes, distended nostrils and clenched teeth
at the speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the demon ails you, man? Are you mad?” exclaimed
the rebel captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would return the question! What ails you? Are
you mad? Are you drawing imaginary pictures black as
the scenes of Dante’s Inferno? Are you talking at random?
Do you know what you are saying?” demanded
Justin, glaring at his guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know very well what I am saying; I am saying
that we have stormed and carried Fort Sumter! That
we have dragged down to the dust the proud Star-Spangled
Banner that never was humbled before!” said the
rebel captain, helping himself to another great bumper
of the strong old brandy that was now beginning to affect
even his seasoned system, so as to inflame his blood
and dim his perceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Oh! dread God of Battles, where stayed thy thunderbolts?”
exclaimed Justin, starting from the table and
hurriedly pacing the whole length of the grotto.</p>

<p class='c007'>He felt an almost uncontrollable desire to take this man
by the throat and hurl him through the door; but he remembered
that the man was his own invited guest, and
had sat at his board, broken his bread, and drank his
health; he also reflected that only from this man could
he get the information which he was so anxious to obtain,
and so restrained his impulse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Captain Spear deceived himself with that
common delusion which blinded so many Secessionists to
the sentiments of loyal Southerners, whom they supposed
to be fellow Secessionists, merely because they were fellow-citizens;
and his perceptions were still further obscured
by the fumes of the brandy he had swallowed, and
so he utterly misunderstood the character of Justin Rosenthal,
and mistook the cause of his excitement. He believed
that the young man, being a native of the South,
must be an advocate of Secession, and that his great
emotion was in sympathy with his own high exultation
over the victory he had just been describing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you will only sit down and compose yourself, my
young friend, I will go on with the play. There are
greater glories to come than any I have yet described, I
can tell you!” said the rebel captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, go on with the play!” said Justin, throwing himself
into his chair, but averting his face from the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The curtain rises on Act 3rd, Scene 1st. There is
another grand spectacular scene! Again the whole depth
of the stage; the full strength of the company; pyrotechnics—dazzling
effects! In a word The Battle of Manassas!
The great Federal army under General McDowell—the
Great Confederate army under General Beauregard.
Tremendous engagement! Terrific fighting! Total rout
of the Federals! Complete triumph of the Confederates!
Grand tableau!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the captain paused, helped himself to another
bumper of the old Otard, swallowed it at a gulp, closed
his eyes, and leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on,” said Justin, scarcely able to speak for the
strong emotion that nearly choked his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“That’s all. I have finished the bottle, and I have finished
the tale; or, rather, all I have to tell. When the
curtain dropped on that scene I left the theatre of war,
at least in regard to the military branch of action. In
short, I received letters of marque from the Confederate
Government, authorizing me to cruise in quest of
Federal prizes, and I took the command of the privateer
<em>Sea Scourge</em>. I have already taken a few Federal merchant
ships; but after appropriating their cargoes and
money chests, was obliged unfortunately to scuttle and
sink them. Hadn’t enough men to spare, you see, to man
them and send them home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And their unfortunate crew?” groaned Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a pity,” said the drunken captain, sleepily,
“but I had to sink them with their ships! Hadn’t men
enough to guard them!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I am cruising about in these latitudes, lying in
wait for returning East Indiamen, which are always rich
prizes and easy prey, being without guns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so!” exclaimed Justin, no longer able to restrain
himself, but bounding to his feet, and seizing the rebel
captain by the throat, and shaking him violently—“and so
I have been harboring no less a miscreant than a licensed
pirate, who takes advantage of his letters of marque and
makes war—not upon men-of-war, but upon defenseless
merchantmen—seizing their cargoes, murdering their
crews, and scuttling their ships!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a mil—lil—litary necessity, commodore!”
spluttered the wretch, gasping and choking in the viselike
grasp of the furious young athlete.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your instant execution is a moral necessity, miscreant!”
thundered Justin, shaking him by the throat as
though he would have shaken his sinful soul from his
brutal body.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin! Justin! forbear! would you murder the villain
at your own board!” frantically exclaimed Britomarte,
starting up and seizing the arm of the young man.
“Would you murder him before my eyes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would execute him now and here! for he deserves
instant death!” cried the young man, tightening his grasp
until the pirate grew black in the face.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“Justin! Justin! spare him! not for his sake, but for
your own honor! He is too much intoxicated to defend
himself. He is helpless as a child in your grasp! For
your own honor, Justin! curb your just rage and spare a
defenseless man!” pleaded Britomarte, clinging to her
lover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will obey you, my queen! I will spare the miscreant,
though he does not deserve to be spared, never having
spared others!” replied Justin, hurling from him the
form of the pirate, who fell heavily, striking his head
upon the stone floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Justin! I fear that he is already dead!” exclaimed
Britomarte, approaching the motionless form of the pirate,
who, from the united effects of drunkenness, suffocation,
and concussion, was now quite insensible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is dead drunk, that is all,” replied Justin, turning
the body half over with his foot and then leaving it.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went to the entrance of the cavern and looked out.
The men that had been grouped before the door were nowhere
in sight; but Judith was walking about gathering
up crusts and bones and other litter left by them on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin beckoned her to approach, and she came.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you doing, Judith?” he inquired, in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Claning up the yard afther the saymen, sure. Troth,
they’re as dirthy as pigs at their males, so they are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where have they gone, Judith?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Divil a bit iv me knows! They took up the keg iv
whisky ye gave them, so they did, and walked off wid it
before me two looking eyes. Meself thinks they have
carried it down to the boat, and are stealing it off to the
ship unbeknownst to the captain! Sure I called to them
to stop; but they told me ye gave them the whisky itself,
which I couldn’t contradict.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad they are gone, Judith; but I suppose they
will come back here presently for their captain. Come
in here, Judith, a moment; I wish to speak with you,”
said Justin, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith came into the grotto, wondering. But when she
saw the insensible form of the pirate captain, she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“Lorrud kape us! I thought how it would be! Sure
he’s afther dhrinking a whole bottle iv that strong old
brandy, and has fallen down dead dhrunk, so he has.
Sure, sir, where will we drag him away to?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nowhere, Judith! he must remain just where he is
until his men return to take him! But draw near and
listen to me. This man is not a Confederate officer, nor
is his ship a Confederate privateer. Neither would be acknowledged
by the Confederate States. The Southern
people would not tolerate piracy. This man has taken
advantage of civil war to become a pirate. You have
heard and read enough to be able to know and dread the
lawlessness and cruelty of these pirates——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pirates! Lord betune us from harrm, are they pirates?”
exclaimed Judith, opening her mouth and eyes
and suspending her breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are pirates, Judith. Now compose yourself, my
good girl. And, dear Britomarte, attend. You must
take Judith with you and leave this grotto. You must
both go up the mountain to my hole in the rock, which is
the safest hiding place on the whole island. You must
conceal yourselves there until these men have finally left
the island and their ship has sailed. If they do not see
you again they may not think of you. Or even if they do
think of you, they will never be able to find you in that
secure retreat. Go at once!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you, Justin—but you,” exclaimed Miss Conyers,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can take care of myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, how? Oh, how? Think of the fury of that
wretch when he recovers his senses, and remembers the
punishment you inflicted on him. Think of the vengeance
of his crew. What could you, one man, do
against the pirate and all his band?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte, you who have no fears for yourself,
should have none for me. Only death can come to me.
Worse, infinitely worse, might reach you. Go, dear Britomarte.
Go at once. These miscreants may be even
now on their way here,” he urged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin, once before I was forced from your side in an
hour of deadly peril. I will not be so again,” she replied,
looking white, and firm as marble.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Dear Britomarte, you shall be forced to nothing, but
you shall be convinced of the necessity of following my
advice. The peril you dread for me is nothing—nothing.
That drunken brute whose recovery you dread so much,
will not come to his senses for many hours. His men,
when they come for him, will have to carry him off in his
present state of unconsciousness. And even when he
does recover, it is not likely that he will remember anything
about the choking he got from me. As to the
crew, I have treated them kindly. They will be contented
with helping themselves to everything they want,
and they will leave me in peace. It is you and Judith
only who will be in peril from them—in awful peril, if
they see you. Go, Britomarte. Oh, dear Britomarte,
hasten!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot bear to leave you alone to meet that desperate
band!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte! I can take care of myself by staying here,
but I can only take care of you by concealing you in the
cavern. Britomarte, listen. In that horrible Sepoy insurrection
in India a few years ago, when the banded
fiends invested the Tower of Djel and carried it by storm,
the young English officer commanding the place shot his
young bride through the brain, to save her from falling
into the hands of those demons! Britomarte, if you do
not follow my counsel and conceal yourself in the cavern,
that may be the only means left me to save you from
worse than death!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still she hesitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would rather fall by your hand than be forced to
leave you in an hour of danger!” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte, I repeat you shall be forced to do nothing—not
even to save yourself; but if you persist in remaining
here, you will drive me mad!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go, then,” she answered, reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not to give her time to think the matter over, he
slipped her arm in his and led her from the grotto,
calling to the panic-stricken Irish girl to follow them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holding her hand, he helped her to ascend the almost
inaccessible height where his “hole in the rock” was situated.</p>

<p class='c007'>He put her and her attendant in there; and then he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>closed the opening with fragments of rock, so loosely
put together as not to exclude the air; and then he stuck
green brushwood in between them in such a way as to
make it look like growing bushes and conceal the entrance
from the most prying eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having completed his task, he put his head down
among the brushwood and his lips to a small crevice between
the fragments of rock, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-night, dear Britomarte! Trust in Providence
and keep up your spirits. As soon as the pirate ship
has gone I will come and release you, and all will be
well.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br> <span class='c005'>AT BAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Justin returned to the grotto and busied himself with
putting out of sight all Britomarte’s and Judith’s little
personal effects that might have tempted the cupidity of
the pirates or reminded them of the presence of women
on the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having done this, he went to one of the caverns where
the stores taken from the ship were kept, and he selected
from them tobacco, pipes, whisky, greatboots, sticks,
guns, pistols, swords, sabres, a little of everything, in
fact, that looked like a man’s peculiar property and suggested
only the presence of man, and he brought them
into the grotto and scattered them about in careless disorder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he sat down to rest and to wait for what should
come next.</p>

<p class='c007'>With rest came the opportunity of reflection, for up to
this moment he had acted from impulse only. But now
in the midst of his clear sense of the danger that threatened
not only himself, but her who was dearer to him
than his own life, he thought with keen anxiety of his beloved
native country, plunged in all the horrors of civil
war and menaced with destruction. And, oh! the intolerable
longing that filled his soul to get back to her, to
fight for her, and, if need were, to die for her. But this
could not be, he knew. The ship that he had hoped would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>have borne him and his companions back to their homes
was now discovered to be a pirate, sailing under false
colors, and making prey of unarmed merchantmen. He
and his party, if they should escape death from the crew,
must remain on the lone island waiting for the improbable
event of another vessel’s arrival to take them off.
But even in his deepest distress Justin did not despair; his
trust in Divine Providence was too strong to permit him
to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>While thus reflecting, he suddenly became conscious
of the approach of the pirate crew.</p>

<p class='c007'>He arose to his feet, and standing over the unconscious
form of the drunken captain, waited to receive them.</p>

<p class='c007'>They reached the front of the grotto; but they did
not come in immediately; they stood about in groups and
seemed to be waiting a summons, until at length one of
their number advanced to the door of the grotto and
touched his hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my man, what is wanted?” inquired Justin, assuming
a calmness he was far from feeling; and yet his
disturbance was not upon his own account, but solely
upon Britomarte’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you please, sir, we wanted to tell the captain that
the tide serves,” replied the man, civilly enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin pointed at the insensible form at his feet, but
even before he had done so the man’s eye had fallen on
it, and the man’s disgust broke out in an oath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By ——! There he is again, as drunk as ——!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you are going to make sail, my man, you and your
mates will have to take your captain and carry him off
in his present state,” said Justin, speaking with a forced
quietness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By all the fiends in flames, we’d serve him right to
leave him here! And a precious good opportunity to
get rid of him; and a glorious riddance it would be, too!”
said the man, stooping over and staring at the fallen
captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You would not surely abandon your chief in his present
helpless state of unconsciousness?” remonstrated
Justin, who had no desire to receive the pirate permanently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wouldn’t we, though? I don’t know why we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>come back for him at all, that I don’t! If anybody had
stated the proposition to sail without him, I’m sure we
would have done it. If we leave him here it will save
his life and save us the trouble of cutting his throat,
which we would be sure to do before long,” said the
man, coolly, as with his hands on his knees he stooped
low and stared intently into the stupid face of the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he so very unpopular on his ship, then?” inquired
Justin, as with difficulty he repressed the disgust and horror
awakened by the man’s words and manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unpopular! Why, shiver my timbers, if we have
ever been in a fight or storm yet that he hasn’t got as
drunk as Julius Cæsar, and left the ordering of the fight,
or the working of the ship, to Mate Mulligan. And Mulligan
we want for our captain. And Mulligan we mean
to have!” said the man, suddenly turning and leaving the
unconscious captain and going out to his companions, to
whom he began to talk in a low and earnest voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin did not attempt to follow or to interfere with
him. Upon reflection he was glad that a subject so full
of interest and excitement as the disposition and desertion
of their captain by his crew should have arisen to engage
their thoughts and prevent them from remembering the
existence of the women on the island. He watched the
man who was haranguing his mates outside; he saw how,
with eager eyes and fierce gestures, they crowded around
him; and so he was not surprised when the speaker at
length left his turbulent hearers and returned to the
grotto door and touched his hat and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Master, the boys mean to leave that lubber here and
elect Mate Mulligan captain and me first mate. But,
master, we will take you off, as you have done the handsome
by us in the matter of the keg of whisky; if you
don’t mind cruising round a bit with the certainty of a
fight now and then, and the chance of some day or other
getting into port somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; but I am colonized here for the present,
and do not wish to leave just yet,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just as you please, master! Have you got any more
of that good liquor left?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, there it is; help yourselves; you are quite welcome
to the whisky, tobacco, pipes, or anything else you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>may see here in my Robinson Crusoe establishment,” said
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now that is what I call handsome! Here, mates,
lend a hand and help to carry some of this liquor and
’bacco to the boats!” said the man, once more going to
the door and calling to his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all came in at his summons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin noticed that the man whom Captain Spear had
called Mulligan was not among them. And thus he
knew that Mulligan had no part in the mutiny, and had
been elected captain of the pirate ship in his absence,
without his knowledge, and possibly against his will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men touched their hats, civilly, to their host, and
then began to take up the articles pointed out, and to
carry them off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by, master! Sorry to leave so kind a host!
Call again when we pass this way! Meantime, wish you
joy of the new comrade we have left you!” said the ringleader
of the mutiny, as with a bottle of whisky in each
of his pockets and one in each of his hands, he followed
the last sailor from the grotto.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin went to the door and watched them out of
sight, and then he took his telescope and climbed the
mountain to the tableland on the summit and watched
them as they entered their boat and rowed toward the
ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the aid of his glass he saw them embark, unload
their boat and draw it up and secure it to the davits; and
still he watched them while they got up their anchor,
spread their canvas to the breeze and made sail; and still
further he watched until the ship had sailed away from
the island and waned in the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he hurried down the mountain side and into the
grotto to look after the pirate captain, his late guest, who
was henceforth to be his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found Captain Spear still in the heavy sleep of intoxication.</p>

<p class='c007'>He left him and went to one of the caverns where articles
rescued from the wreck were kept, and looked up
a set of fetters, consisting of handcuffs and anklets, such
as are often kept on board East Indiamen for the restraint
of a possible mutineer or other criminal. He had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>brought them off the wreck, not with the most distant
idea that he should ever be obliged to put them to their
legitimate use, but for the same reason that he saved
every portable piece of iron that he could find—namely,
because he knew that it would be valuable on their desert
island, where they might remain for years, or for life,
cut off from all supplies from without.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having found the fetters, he returned to the grotto,
and, stooping down, fastened them upon the wrists and
ankles of the sleeping pirate.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br> <span class='c005'>THE CAGED TIGER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Captain Spear awoke his rage knew no bounds,
but Justin firmly made him acquainted with the state of
affairs, whereupon the captain became sulky and refused
to take any food, saying that he preferred to die and that
his death would be laid at the door of Justin, who would
meet his due reward when his crime was discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning he had so far relented as to drink a cup
of Judy’s tea, given with reluctance by the Irishwoman,
who vowed that hanging was too good for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of a few days he came sulkily out of his
cavern and crept about through the groves and by the
streams, or along the seashore of the beautiful island.
He had a limited use of his fettered limbs—enough to
help himself in all absolute personal needs; for instance,
he could walk slowly, wash his face, or feed himself; but
he could not inflict the slightest injury upon either of the
women, if he happened to meet them together or singly
in his rambles about the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whenever he met Judith, she mocked him.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he met Miss Conyers, she returned his greeting
kindly. If the arch enemy of God and man had been their
prisoner she could not have treated him unkindly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin always used him humanely, and encouraged his
companions in exile to do likewise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The man has forfeited his life by every law of every
civilized land! but we are not warranted to become his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>executioners. We have only to deprive him of the power
of committing more crime, and then to treat him with
Christian charity,” he argued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin Rosenthal was now a very busy man. In the
two years that he and his friends had spent upon the
island he had made what progress was possible in “making
the wilderness to bloom and blossom as the rose.” The
first few months had been spent in the stupendous labor
of getting the stores, the animals and the furniture from
the wreck over the long, rugged, almost impassable reef
of rocks to the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the time that nearly incredible work had been successfully
accomplished, the rainy season, the winter of
these latitudes, had set in, and all further outdoor work
was suspended for several months.</p>

<p class='c007'>When spring and sunshine had come again, it was
necessary, first of all, to build fences to guard the fields
and gardens that were to be cultivated from the intrusion
of the cattle and poultry; then to till the ground and
plant the seeds, of which he had found a great variety
in the stores of the missionaries, consisting of wheat, rye
and Indian corn among the field grains, and beans, peas,
potatoes, turnips, cabbage, lettuce and so forth among
the garden seeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, the planting of all these seeds, many of
which were indigenous to the north temperate zone only,
was a questionable experiment, to be tried.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this—fence building, soil tilling, seed planting and
cultivating—was a long labor for one pair of hands,
and it occupied the whole spring and half the summer.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the labor was crowned with all the prosperity that
could be hoped. At least half the garden seeds produced
good crops of table vegetables. Among the grain the
wheat did very well, the Indian corn still better, but the
cotton was the greatest success of all. Justin had traveled
all over the cotton growing States of his native country,
but never had he seen such great white pods of such
rich, fine fibre anywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early autumn months were occupied in harvesting
these crops.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this work Britomarte and Judith were able to help
Justin. While Justin cut the wheat, Britomarte picked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>the great pods of cotton from their stalks and housed them
in the grotto, and Judith pulled the ripe ears of Indian
corn and stored them in her kitchen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The end of this work had brought the beginning of
their second winter on the island, and again all outdoor
labor was suspended.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those wintry days and evenings were spent very profitably.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith and Britomarte picked the cotton, separating the
seed from the wool with their fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, who possessed great mechanical ingenuity, constructed
a wheel for Judith. A pair of cards had been
found among the stores of the wreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith carded and spun the cotton wool into fine yarn,
and Britomarte knit it into hose for her two friends and
herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin also began to try to construct a loom for weaving,
but as the task was a difficult one to a man not
brought up to the trade, he had many failures before he
had any prospect of success.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus had passed the second winter of their sojourn
upon the island. It was near the end of the second summer
that the pirate ship had anchored near their island,
and the captain, by a strange turn of fate, had become
their prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now Justin was very busy getting in his second
summer’s crops and building up his long delayed dwelling
houses.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br> <span class='c005'>BRITOMARTE’S NEW HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Before the end of the autumn Britomarte’s house was
completed. A rough house it was, indeed; not at all
like those of the north temperate zone, yet possessed of
some advantages peculiar to itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its architect was limited in the matter of hand tools and
of building materials; for the first he had to depend upon
the carpenter’s box rescued from the wreck, and for the
second upon the cocoa-palm trees and the mountain rocks.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Its site was selected in front of the cocoa-palm grove,
facing the sea, and looking westward toward their native
hemisphere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its plan was simple enough, and had first been drawn
by Justin upon paper. It was a low, square, spacious
house, all of one story, to keep it safe from destruction
by the tornadoes that sometimes visited the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>It contained four large rooms, separated by two long
passages that ran, one from front to back and the other
from end to end, crossing each other at right angles in
the centre of the house, so that each room was completely
divided from the others. It had four doors, one at each
extremity of the two passages. The rooms had each two
windows in the outer walls, and two doors opening into
the passages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The walls were built of the long, straight, smooth
trunks of the cocoa-palm tree, which, in the absence of a
sawmill, formed the very best substitutes for planks. The
roof was made of transverse poles cut from the trunks
of very young trees and covered with the broad, strong,
feathery palm leaves, laid one over another in rows, and
kept down by other transverse poles securely fastened.
This rustic roof afforded a complete protection against
the rain and the wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The kitchen chimney was built of fragments of rock
joined with a strong cement made by mixing the sap of
the cocoa tree with lime burned by Justin from the shells
and bones collected from the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were no floors, except the ground, which was
leveled and beaten hard. The walls inside were made
smooth by a rude plastering of moistened soil packed in
between the logs. And then both floor and walls were
covered with the cement, that gave them the appearance
of cream-colored stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>I said the house fronted west. The windows of the
two front rooms only were glazed with glass, taken from
the sashes in the cabin of the wreck. They had also
shutters. The two back rooms had shutters only.</p>

<p class='c007'>The northwestern front room was the family parlor.
It was neatly fitted up with the furniture rescued from
the saloon of the wreck. It had a red carpet on the floor,
a centre table and a lamp, a side table and bookshelves, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>sofa, a rocking-chair and four common chairs, and lighter
articles too numerous and trivial to mention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The southwestern front room was Britomarte’s bedchamber,
which was also shared by Judith. It was
daintily fitted up with furniture saved from the ladies’
cabin and berths of the wreck. It had a neat carpet on
the floor, white curtains at the windows, and two little
white beds, in opposite corners. It had also a chest
of drawers surmounted by a looking glass, flanked by a
workbox and a dressing case; a washstand provided with
a white china basin, ewer and soap dish, only a little the
worse for being knocked about in the wreck; a low chair,
a footstool, a little candlestand, and other small conveniences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The southwestern back room was Justin’s sleeping
apartment. It was fitted up with severe simplicity. The
windows were not even glazed, but were only provided
with rough wooden shutters; the hard floor was bare;
the bed was a narrow mattress laid upon a rude bedstead;
the washstand was a broad wooden shelf, with a tin basin
and a stone pitcher; the chair was a three-legged stool,
and the wardrobe a few strong pegs driven into the walls,
upon which he hung his clothes. All these primitive articles
of furniture were of his own manufacture, from fragments
of the wreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>This rude seaside dwelling place was fenced in by a
low wall made by driving short stakes, cut from the cocoa
tree, closely together into the ground after the manner
of a stockade; and two rude gates, one front and one
back, gave entrance and exit to the premises.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the back of the yard there was a small storehouse,
or pantry, built to keep a limited supply of provisions—the
great bulk of their provisions being still kept in the
mountain grottoes, where they could best be preserved.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few tropical vines had been transplanted from the
thicket at the base of the mountain to the soil in front of
the house, and had readily taken root, and were now
trained up to festoon and shade the windows and doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of the first autumn month all was ready.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was on a certain Wednesday afternoon that our
friends first took possession of their new home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, having seen the women established, went to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>outdoor work, which was just now the transplanting of
some young fruit trees that he had raised in a nursery
from the seeds, and that now needed to be set out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte took her needlework—some shirts that she
was neatly repairing for Justin—and seated herself beside
the front window of her bedchamber, looking out
to the western sea, and across toward her own native land.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a novelty and a delight—perhaps the greatest
novelty and the greatest delight of the whole change—to
be able to sit sewing at an open window, and looking
out upon the land, sea and sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heretofore, since she had been on the island, she had
not been able to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her grotto had been a beautiful place—a wood-nymph’s
bower, a fairy queen’s palace; but it had no windows, and
its lofty skylight, though it illuminated the whole place,
afforded no outlook whatever, and gave but a limited
glimpse of the sky. When she had sat there and sewed
her vision had been bounded by the walls of solid rock,
which had given a prison aspect to her dwelling place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now all this was changed.</p>

<p class='c007'>She sat sewing at a cheerful, open, white-curtained window,
letting her eyes rove, whenever she raised her head,
freely over land and sea and sky, with a buoyant sense
of liberty and—a touching sense of gratitude also!</p>

<p class='c007'>Who was it that had changed her life so happily? Nay,
who had saved, sustained and blessed her life, ever since
she had been cast, a helpless creature, on this desert
island?</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin Rosenthal, a man, one of the common enemy,
one of the hated sex, one of the despots, the oppressors
and despoilers of women!</p>

<p class='c007'>They spent their first evening in the new house, around
the center-table in the parlor. The lamp was not lighted;
for the windows were open, and the full moon was shining
so splendidly as to make all the land and sea and the
sky almost as bright as noonday—quite as bright as a
London day.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a new delight to Britomarte, on rising in the
morning, to be able to throw open a window shutter and
gaze out upon the broad expanse of sea and sky; another
to eat breakfast in a large parlor, with the cheerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>light of the morning sun shining in at the eastern windows;
and still another to change from room to room and
enjoy the aspect of each in turn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure this is house-kaping at lingth, ma’am, isn’t it?
It’s having a home iv our own, ‘if it’s iver so homely,’
as the song says. It’s domestic happiness intirely, so it
is,” said Judith, as she was assisting Miss Conyers to set
the bedchambers in order.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have to thank Heaven and Mr. Rosenthal for it
all, Judith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, and so I do, ma’am. And day and night I wish
myself was a praist so I could marry you two togither,
an’ faix it’s the only thing I’m unable to do for ye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast every day Justin went out to his outdoor
work. He set out a large number of young fruit
trees that he had raised from the seed—plum, peach and
apricot trees. Their cultivation upon this new soil, in
this new climate, was an experiment which only time
could decide to be a success or a failure.</p>

<p class='c007'>His next work was to gather in and store the late crops
of grain.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the time this was done the wet season set in with
great severity; and the castaways were confined for the
most part to indoor occupations.</p>

<p class='c007'>But they were not idle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin would not lumber up the women’s apartments—as
he called the parlor, kitchen and best bedchamber—with
any of his cumbersome working materials; but he
gathered them all into his own Spartan room, and there
he busied himself through the first wet days with grinding,
mending and arranging his tools; and then he took a
great quantity of palm leaves that he had collected during
the dry months and he occupied himself with stripping
them up and weaving their fibres into mats of every
description—large, thin mats to lay before the doors to
wipe shoes upon in muddy weather, and small fine mats
to put on the table to set dishes on.</p>

<p class='c007'>As these mats were completed he delivered them over
to Judith to be stored or to be used. The girl was especially
delighted with the door mats, which she declared
would save her a “dale iv scrubbing;” and she was profuse
in her expressions of gratitude to Justin, whom she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>declared to be always saving her life entirely with his
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p class='c007'>After having made a quantity of mats of all sorts, Justin
commenced the manufacture of baskets. First he
made a fine large clothes basket, which became the pride
of Judith’s life; and then a dozen or more of fruit and
vegetable baskets of all sizes; and, lastly, a workbasket
for Britomarte, on which he expended his finest materials,
and all the taste, skill and ingenuity he possessed.
It was a miracle of convenience, if not of beauty. It was
rather large and oval in form; the middle space long
enough to contain a good-sized garment folded up; and
all around that middle space little divisions like smaller
baskets, to hold buttons, hooks and eyes, cord, tape,
thread, etc., and to keep them separate and in order; each
little division had its little movable top; and the whole
basket had its cover and its handle. I have been particular
in describing this little affair, because its invention
was a work of love, and its usefulness every woman
among my readers will appreciate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte valued it not upon account of its beauty or
its usefulness so much as because its every mesh and
fibre had been woven by those beloved hands that were
dearer to her than all others; yes, deny it to herself as
she might, dearer to her than all others upon earth!</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith was in rapture with the basket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a beauty iv a basket! a darlint iv a basket! a little
angel iv a basket! And sure meself wishes I was
clever at the nadle, so I could use one, too. But faix if
I can manage to put a patch in an ould tablecloth, it’s as
much as meself can do,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind, Judith. You can weave, and that is
what neither Miss Conyers nor myself can do. I shall
make another attempt at the construction of a loom this
winter; and I think between my recollections of my
grandmother’s loom and your suggestions, I shall be able
to construct one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, thin, if ye’d only do that same, sure I could waive
beautiful cloth out iv the lovely cotton and woolen yarn
I carded and spun last winter, or last wit season—if that’s
winter—though I’m thinking it’s hot as the dhry season
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>itself; and faix I can’t tell winther from summer in this
haythen iv a climate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin kept his word with Judith and labored with
the loom, putting it together and taking it to pieces, doing
and undoing his work, hammering and tinkering at
it all day long—when he had nothing better to do—for, in
fact, the experiment of loom building was not sufficiently
full of promise of success to justify the wasting upon it
time that might be more profitably employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the evening he joined Britomarte in the parlor, and
read aloud, while she sewed and Judith knitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus passed their indoor life during the wet season.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXX.<br> <span class='c005'>THE OLD FAMILIAR FLAG.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When spring and sunshine came again, Justin began to
lay out new garden beds and to put in the seeds for early
vegetables.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Judith, to her heart’s delight, began what she
called her “spring claning.” But first of all, as their
boxes of hard brown soap had nearly given out, Judith
showed her skill in the manufacture of soft soap from lye
made of wood ashes, and grease melted from kitchen fat.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she had succeeded in this, she commenced her
“claning.” Every housekeeper knows what that process
is in the hands of a skillful woman; so it is enough to
say that Judith accomplished the task in the best possible
manner; and that at the end of a week’s work, the house
and all within and around it was as clean and neat as human
skill and human hands could make it. White curtains
replaced the red ones at all the windows; and the
winter carpets were stowed away and the floors were covered
with the matting that Justin had manufactured from
the long fibres of the palm leaves during the winter
months.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Judith had been engaged in the housecleaning
Britomarte had employed herself in laying out the front
yard in parterres and planting them with flower seeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Justin, in the intervals of his field and garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>work, built a neat cover over a clear spring at a short
distance from the house; he built it of stone for coolness,
and dug a channel for the spring to flow through, and
paved and cemented it, so that the pans of milk and cream
and pots of butter could be set in the running water. Adjoining
the dairy was a temporary shed, where the cow
could be driven to be fed and milked in bad weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, it’s all beautiful entirely; and I wish Crummie
could go on giving millik foriver, so I do! But that can’t
be expicted, and sure she must go dhry some day, and
thin whativer shall we do? Och-hone!” cried Judith,
as she contemplated her new dairy, and felt herself divided
between delight in its acquisition and dread of the
calamity she had foreshadowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind, Judith. ‘Sufficient unto the day,’ you
know. And we cannot tell what may happen before
Crummie goes dry. We may all be safe at home in our
dear native land by that time,” said Justin, soothingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! Lord send that same! But aven so, all our labor
here will be lost! Och-hone! whichiver way one
looks it’s heartbreaking, so it is!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense! whichever way one looks the prospect is
encouraging! If we are to spend our days here, we shall
grow more and more comfortable every day of our lives;
if we are to be rescued from here, we shall return to our
own country. Be reasonable, Judith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, all that’s aisy said! But if Crummie goes dhry,
what thin?” whimpered Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must do without milk. But Crummie is not dry
yet, Judith,” laughed Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then all returned from their inspection of the dairy
and walked toward the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>On their way thither they stopped at the sheepfold to
look at a young lamb whose advent Justin had announced
that morning. When they had sufficiently admired the
pretty little creature, they went on a little further and
paused at the poultry yard to see the broods of young
chickens newly hatched that were the especial care of the
Irish girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The darlints! look at thim! iviry little teeny roly-poly
looking like a little pod of cotton wool! forbye they are
gold-colored instead of white! And to think afther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>watching and feeding and caring for thim all the summer,
I shall maybe have to wring their necks in the autumn.
Faix meself thinks I shall niver have the heart to
do it at all, at all!” laughed Judith, as she gazed upon her
favorites with a strange blending of pride, pity and affection.</p>

<p class='c007'>They turned from the poultry yard and continued their
walk toward the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they went on Britomarte noticed that Justin kept his
eyes fixed uneasily upon the southwestern quarter of the
heavens, where a few wild feathery black clouds flecked
the burning crimson of the sunset.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, Justin?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think we shall have a tornado to-night,” he answered,
gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, even as he spoke, the clouds were driven up
higher and blacker, and the moans of the rising wind
swept over the sea and land.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we shall certainly have a tornado! Hurry on to
the house, dear Britomarte! I must go back and put the
animals under cover,” said Justin, suddenly turning back
and hastening toward the sheepfold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And sure I must go and see if all the little chicks are
safe in the henhouse, and lock the door and stop the hole
to keep them in it,” said Judith, as suddenly hastening
after him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte, left alone, pursued her way toward the
house, while darker grew the sky and deeper moaned the
wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the few minutes that passed before she reached the
house, the heavens had grown black as night and formed
a wild contrast to the ocean, which, as far as the eye
could see, was one mass of boiling snow-white foam,
across which the rising wind moaned and wailed as a
prophetic spirit lamenting the woe to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte hurried into the house and began to let
down the windows and close the shutters, hoping and
praying all the time that Justin and Judith might return
before the storm should burst.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she had securely fastened up the house, as it was
now pitch dark, she lighted the lamp and sat down to
wait for the return of her friends.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>The thunder rolled and broke, crash upon crash, like
the explosion and fall of a world overhead, at the same
instant that the lightning shot like shafts of fire through
every crevice in the house, and the rain came down as if
the “windows of heaven” had been opened for another
flood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven protect them!” exclaimed Britomarte, clasping
her hands and thinking of her friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she suddenly started up and ran to the door to
listen for their coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>As she got there she heard rapid steps and hurried
speech, followed immediately by loud knocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>She tore the door open, and they rushed in, Justin,
Judith and—the pirate captain—followed by the raving
storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, exerting all his great strength, closed and barred
the door against the wind and then turned to Britomarte
and whispered hurriedly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear sister, go into your parlor. I will join you there
presently and explain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte followed his advice, and went back to the
parlor, attended by Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judith,” as soon as they had reached the room and
closed the door, “tell me how Mr. Rosenthal came to
bring that man here to-night? I am glad that he has
done so, but I wish to know how he happened to do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A blinding flash of lightning that shot arrows of fire
through every crack and seam of the house, and a deafening
crash of thunder, like the explosion of a planet overhead,
interrupted Judith in her answer. Instead of replying,
she muttered a pater and told her beads. And it
was not till all was temporarily silent again, and Miss
Conyers had repeated her question, that Judith answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Divil a bit iv me knows at all, at all. Sure I was
running back to the house as fast as me two heels could
fetch me, to get out iv the storm, when I fell over thim
both, close to the door here. And nivir a worrd was
spoken anyther side. And now, ma’am, wid your lave,
I’ll just go and change me clothes, for divil’s a dhry
thread is on me at all, at all, wid the rain that came down
by bucket fulls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go at once, Judith. Hurry, or you may catch cold.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“And so I will hurry, ma’am. Sure it’s a fray shower
bath I’ve had entirely—Glory be to Moses!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This last exclamation was struck from Judith by a
thunderbolt so much more tremendous than anything
which had preceded it, that there is no simile to be found
for it in heaven or on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That must have struck very near us,” said Britomarte,
as the thunder rolled down the abyss of space and died
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mary, Star iv the Say!&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*S’int Pater, pray for
us sinners!”&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* muttered Judith, invoking all
the saints she could think of in an emergency.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you are in more danger from damp clothing
than from the thunderbolts, Judith. Go and change,”
said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we had only a blessed candle itself, this haythen iv
a storm couldn’t hurt us,” whimpered Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have your Heavenly Father, who is the Lord of
the heavens and the earth. Appeal to Him. It is an awful
storm!” said Miss Conyers, as another blinding flash
of lightning pierced every crevice of the closed house, and
another peal of thunder rolled and crashed over their
heads, and died away in the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith told her beads as fast as she could pass them
through her fingers. She was shivering alike with terror
of the tempest and chilliness from her wet clothes.
And Britomarte again urged her to go and change them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure I daresn’t lave the room. If I’m to be sthruck
down dead, I’d like to be wid some one to pick me up
and spake a good worrd to me parting sperrit,” moaned
the panic-stricken girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, Judith, if you are afraid to go alone, I will attend
you with pleasure,” said Miss Conyers, kindly.</p>

<p class='c007'>But just as she spoke Justin Rosenthal opened the
door and entered the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have come to explain to you how I happened to
bring this man home,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Britomarte could answer, another thunderbolt
fell, seeming to shake the very island from its foundation.
When the noise of the report had rolled away, Justin
repeated his words, and Britomarte answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Justin! as if the humane act of bringing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>wretched man in out of a storm like this required any explanation
among Christians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But has it not occurred to you that I might have put
him into one of the caverns?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you came upon him at some distance from the
mountain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that was just the case. I met him near the
house, just before I met Judith. He was wet to the skin,
shivering with cold, and tottering with weakness. I
think that he is very ill. I have brought him in, taken off
his fetters and his wet garments, and given him a change
of dry clothes and put him on my bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did right, dear Justin, quite right. I could not
like you if you could treat even a bad man badly,” said
Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure the wicked should be thrated according to their
wickedness,” put in Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that were the rule, which of us would go unpunished?”
inquired Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again a blaze of lightning, a crash of thunder, a blast
of wind and a torrent of rain suspended their conversations.
When this burst of the storm was over, Justin
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, as soon as possible, I want Judith to prepare
some gruel, or panado, or broth, or whatever is good for
a sick man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Troth, Judith, will set him up with it, and you, too.
Divil a bit iv me will stir a fut to go nigh the iron stove in
this baste of a storm, for any cause, at all, at all, let
alone to make gruel for a murthering divil like that,
which same would be a timpting iv Providence,” said
Judith, obstinately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go,” said Miss Conyers, and she arose to leave
the room, followed by Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Och-hone! Ow-oo!” howled Judith, running after
them. “Sure will the two iv ye lave me here, to be
sthruck down alone wid the lightening, and all for the
sake iv a haythen iv a pirate? Faix, if ye must return
good for avil to yer enemies, ye needn’t do it by returning
avil for good to yer friends, sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte, unmindful of the storm that must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>iron stove, went to work and prepared a bowl of nice hot
gruel, which Justin took to the sick man.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that, Justin, with the help of Judith, moved the
sofa from the parlor into his room, for his own accommodation,
while the pirate occupied his bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then, though the storm was still raging with tremendous
violence, Justin persuaded Britomarte and Judith
to retire, assuring them that they would be safer
from the lightning in bed than anywhere else.</p>

<p class='c007'>The storm raged through all the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two women suffered great disturbance in their
sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>At one moment they thought the tremendous thunderbolts
that fell so near must crash through roof and ceiling,
and bury them in the ruins of their dwelling; at another,
that the wild wind which howled along the heavens
must lift their frail house, with all its inhabitants, and
hurl it away before the furious hurricane; at another,
that the heavy sea which cannonaded the rocks below
must rise and overwhelm their home, and bear it off to
destruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the mad night of tempest and terror passed at last.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither Judith nor Britomarte knew exactly when they
dropped asleep, except that it must have been near day,
when the storm had expended its violence, and they had
exhausted their strength with watching.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was late in the morning when Britomarte awoke.
She arose without disturbing Judith, who was still sleeping.
She opened the blinds and looked out. The sky
was clear and bright, and the sun was shining down upon
a green and smiling land. The sea, indeed, was still high
and foaming. But a thousand birds were singing their
morning songs of joy at the passing of the storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first, dazzled by the brilliancy of the scene, Britomarte
saw nothing of the damage that had been done.
But as her vision cleared, she saw that trees had been
torn up by the roots, or blown down, or shred of their
branches that strewed the ground. Their outhouses and
fences, indeed, for their very lowliness, had escaped the
fury of the storm, and were standing safe. Such was the
aspect of the land.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>The sea, as far as the eye could reach, was one vast
expanse of foam; but it was evidently subsiding.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Britomarte gazed from the window, Judith
awoke with a start, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lorrd forgive me, ma’am, are you up, and meself
snoring away here in bed? Why didn’t ye call me,
sure?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And with that she jumped up and began to dress herself
in great haste.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was no such imminent need to break your rest
after such a night of disturbance, Judith,” said Miss Conyers,
leaving the window and beginning her own morning
toilet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure it was a storm to be remimbered all the days of
one’s life, so it was,” said Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is past,” answered Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were dressed Britomarte went into the parlor
to open the windows and set the table, and Judith
into the kitchen to make the fire and get the breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon Justin came out of his room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-morning, sister! The dreadful night is over,
thank Heaven! How did you pass it?” he inquired of
Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As Macbeth passed the night of Banquo’s murder,
in ‘starts and flaws,’” said Britomarte, smiling.
“How is your sick man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a fever. We shall have to keep him here for a
few days until he gets better. I hope that Miss Riordan
will not object to giving him a cup of tea and a round of
dry toast this morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no! Now that Judith’s panic has passed, she has
come to her senses,” said Miss Conyers, going into the
kitchen to give the requisite orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll jist tell ye what, ma’am! There was only eight
barrels iv flour saved out’n the wreck, and for nearly two
years we three people have been eating of it; and for
more than six months we four, counting the pirate, have
been using it! And, though I’ve eked it out as well as I
could, wid using male and rice and vigitables, still it is
getting low! We’ve opened the last barrel, and this is the
last loaf iv bread made out iv it; and I want it to last till
to-morrow, so I do! And now you want to throw away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>a lot iv it in dhry toast for that haythen!” said the indignant
Irish girl, as soon as she had received Miss Conyers’
orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judith, I am ashamed of you! If it was our last loaf
we should divide with a sick man, though that sick man
were the greatest miscreant on earth! And with a whole
barrel of flour, and when the flour gives out, a whole
hogshead of wheat in the grain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yis; but how is the whate to be ground at all, at all?
Sure it will be slow work grinding it in the coffeemill!
Troth it’s to your own interests I’m spaking—not mine!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it, Judith. But now do an act of charity, and
procure the tea and toast for the suffering sinner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure I’ll do it to plaze ye, and for no other raison in
life,” said Judith, as she went about to execute the order.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this refreshment was ready, Justin took it in to
the sick man and served him carefully before coming to
his own breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte waited for Justin, and when he returned,
the coffee, rice muffins and broiled birds were brought in
and they sat down to the table to enjoy their morning
meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>After it was over, Justin took some books and carried
them in to the sick man, who seemed to be suffering from
a severe cold and debility more than any other illness.
And then Justin went out to his work, which upon this
day consisted of clearing away the litter strewn all over
the ground by the storm of the past night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte went into her chamber and sat down at her
favorite window to sew and to watch the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was turning a dress for Judith, and she pinned the
end of it to her apron while running up a long seam.
Every time she found it necessary to change the place of
the pin, she raised her head and looked out at the ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>How monotonous and solitary looked that ocean! No
change ever came over it except the change from storm
to calm or from day to night, and <em>vice versa</em>. No living
thing ever appeared on it or above it except the plunging
fish and the sailing water fowl. But she loved it; and
she watched its gradual subsidence from passion to peace
as she would have watched the falling to sleep of some
sufferer who was dear to her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>All the long forenoon she sat sewing and watching the
ocean. Towards noon it had become wonderfully calm,
considering the recent storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once, on changing the place of the pin that held her
work, she looked up and gazed far out to sea—far out to
where the western horizon touched the water. She held
her breath—she strained her eyes—and then with a cry
she started up, threw down her work, ran into the parlor,
caught up the pocket telescope, rushed back to the window,
kneeled down, drew out the cylinders, rested it upon
the window sill, trained it toward the western horizon,
and put her eye to the glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it was a ship!—a ship of war; for she could see
the guns—a ship of the Union, for she could see the
Stars and Stripes! And it was standing in directly for
the island!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a great cry of joy she dropped her head upon her
hands and thanked God.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she sprang up and ran out of the house to look
for Justin. She ran up and down, and all about, calling
him at the top of her voice—calling him as if she had lost
her senses!—calling him until he heard her from his distant
post of labor; and came rushing in great alarm to
meet her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, Britomarte? Compose yourself, dear
sister! I am here at your side! You are safe. But
what has happened? Has that man——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a ship!—it is a national ship!—bearing our own
Stars and Stripes! And she is steering for our own
Cove! Oh, Justin!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Britomarte threw herself upon her brother’s breast
and burst into tears of rapture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin pressed her to his heart again and again. Not
even the arrival of the long-desired, long-prayed-for ship
could make him release her until Judith came flying
toward them to know if her young lady had gone mad
or what had gone wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a ship, Judith! Oh, Judith, it is a ship! And
it bears our Stars and Stripes!” said Britomarte, raising
her head from Justin’s breast, and releasing herself from
his embrace.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Praised be to all the saints!” piously ejaculated
Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Praise be to the merciful lord of heaven and earth!”
said Britomarte, reverently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin lifted his hat and said “Amen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then all three hurried down to the beach by the
cove to look for the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was coming very fast. She was entering the cove!
They could see her colors well with the naked eye. When
she had got a little into the cove, where the water was
smooth, she dropped anchor and let down a boat, which
was soon manned by an officer in the naval uniform of the
United States. A flagstaff, bearing the Stars and Stripes,
was planted in the stern. And the oarsmen pulled stoutly
for the beach.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the boats neared them, Justin raised his hat to salute
the colors. Britomarte waved her handkerchief; Judith
followed suit, and all three simultaneously cried out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hail! hail! hail! to the flag!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Their salutation was answered from the boat. The men
rested on their oars a moment, while they raised their
hats and shouted:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” three times three. And
then they pulled faster than ever for the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The excitement of our party verged upon the madness
of joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte’s rapture burst forth in song—the glorious
“Star-Spangled Banner!” and when she came to the
chorus her companions by her side joined her in singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh, long may it wave</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And the men in the coming boat responded:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh, long <em>shall</em> it wave</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And the next instant the boat touched the strand, the
officer sprang on shore, and the men waved their hats with
another prolonged:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurrah!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br> <span class='c005'>THE GUESTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Welcome.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the first word that sprang alive from the heart
to the lips of Justin Rosenthal, as he held out both his
hands and cordially grasped those of the young officer
who stepped on shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a very handsome fellow, this young sailor, of
slight but elegant figure, of dark olive complexion, dark
brown hair and mustache, and dark, hazel eyes. His
expression of countenance was gracious, his movements
graceful and his manners courteous. In a word, he had
the air of a true gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks,” he answered, lifting his cap and announcing
himself as: “Lieutenant Ethel, of the United States sloop
of war <em>Xyphias</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am rejoiced to see you, lieutenant—truly rejoiced,”
said Justin, with smiling emphasis, as he heartily shook
the hands of the newcomer. “I am Mr. Rosenthal, late
of Washington city,” he added.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very glad to know you, Mr. Rosenthal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And this young lady,” said Justin, turning the lieutenant
toward Britomarte, “is Miss Conyers, also late of
Washington.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the young sailor lifted his hat and bowed profoundly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And this other young person,” said Justin, smiling,
“is Judith Riordan, Miss Conyer’s attendant, and our
companion in exile, and as such as dear to us as a
sister.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad to make her acquaintance,” said Lieutenant
Ethel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now,” said Justin, eagerly, “will you walk up to
our house, while we become better acquainted?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With pleasure,” answered the young officer, and he
immediately offered his arm to Britomarte, as the way
was rugged.</p>

<p class='c007'>But with a courteous smile she declined the assistance;
and they walked on in an irregular group.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Under all these civilities there had been on both sides
a half-suppressed eagerness of curiosity. On that of the
young officer, to know how these American citizens happened
to be found on the desert isle in the Indian Ocean.
And on that of Justin to know how the war went in his
native land; and also with him it was something more
than curiosity; it was almost an agony of anxiety. And
it broke forth as they went on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Outward or homeward bound?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Outward,” replied the young lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry for that! I had hoped that you were going
home. Nevertheless, you are as welcome—as welcome
as—what shall we say, Miss Conyers? What simile
shall we find to express how welcome he is?” said Justin,
turning to Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“None so strong as the simple fact,” answered Britomarte,
and then, turning with a smile to the visitor, she
added: “You are as welcome, sir, as friends from home
to exiles on a desert island.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel bowed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From what port are you last?” inquired Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From New York.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And where bound? You must not take exceptions to
my asking many questions. I shall ask as many as a
Yankee in the pursuit of information under difficulties.
Remember that news is scarce here. In fact, the morning
papers are not delivered with the regularity we could
wish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, pray question me as much as you like. I am
ready to give you all the information in my power. If I
forget to volunteer any, ask me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, where are you bound?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I beg pardon. We are cruising in search of
privateers, reported even down as low as these latitudes,
lying in wait for our returning East Indiamen, which offer
them a rich and easy prey.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah!” exclaimed Justin, breathing hard, “if you are
just from home you can tell us—how goes the war for
the Union?” he eagerly inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fast and furious!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, Heaven! and I not there to take a part! Which
side has the advantage?” he breathlessly questioned.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“The South. Heavens! what a great fight those Southerners
are giving us! By the soul of Washington! none
but our own people could have beaten us so thoroughly as
we have been beaten at Big Bethel, Bull’s Run, Ball’s
Bluff, and the battles that have followed those fatal
fields!” fervently exclaimed the young sailor, with that
generous admiration which every true hero feels for heroism,
even in a foe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I not there to strike a blow!” fumed and fretted
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, hundreds of thousands of brave men are there,
striking hard blows in the good cause.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But still the rebels have the advantage, you say!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; for in every battle they fight as Leonidas fought
at Thermopylæ—as Roland fought at Roncesvalles.
But this state of things cannot last. It is only a question
of time. We shall overwhelm them by numbers at
length, if in no other way. There is something pathetic
and tragical in the aspect of the South now, in the midst
of her delusive victories. It is sad to see so much heroism
and self-devotion wasted upon a cause as evil as it is
hopeless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte turned to look at the young speaker, and
thought that she had never seen a face or heard a voice
more interesting or more eloquent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have a broad vision and a large heart. You are
brave and patriotic, but you are also just and generous.
You fight gallantly for your country, yet you feel deeply
for the brave, misguided men who have brought all this
woe upon her! And you would willingly be the Curtius
to plunge living into this yawning gulf of disunion if
that act would cause it to close above your life!” said
Britomarte, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven knows how willingly I would, lady,” earnestly
answered the young man, reverently raising his
cap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are lingering too long in the sun,” suggested
Justin; “let us hurry on to the house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bedad he’s jealous! and with good reason,” muttered
Judith to herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us get into the house. We have a house, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>on this uncivilized isle,” said Justin, as the whole party
increased their rate of speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but all this time I am struck with astonishment
to find my fellow-citizens here, beating about the walls of
the universe like the lost spirits of the free lovers in
Dante’s “Inferno,” and I am consumed with curiosity to
know how they came to be thrust outside the world,” said
the young lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And, unlike myself, you are too polite to ask questions.
Well, you shall know all about it. But here we
are at the house. Please to walk in,” said Justin, leading
the way through the rustic gate, up a graveled walk, between
borders of fragrant flowers, to the vine-shaded
portico that roofed the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Welcome to our island home!” he added, as he
opened the door and conducted the guest into the hall, and
through that into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks,” said the young stranger, removing his cap,
and gazing around upon one of the pleasantest summer
rooms he had ever seen in his life. Straw matting was
on the floor; snow-white curtains at the vine-shaded windows;
fresh flowers on the mantelshelf and on the tables,
and coolness, comfort and beauty everywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin handed him a chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith ran out to prepare refreshments.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were all seated, the young lieutenant said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Everything I see around you increases my astonishment
and curiosity. You seem really to be comfortable
and permanently colonized here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven forbid!” exclaimed Justin, quickly. “We
have been here over two years, and passed a not unhappy
period. But we have had enough of it, and want to get
home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But—how—came—you—here?” inquired the young
man, slowly and emphatically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! you have really asked the question at last. I
thought I should bring you to it!” laughed Justin. Then,
growing suddenly grave, as he thought of the shipwreck,
he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You remember the ill-fated <em>Sultana</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“East Indiaman? sailed from Boston for Calcutta last
October was two years ago? Yes, I should think I did.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>I was on the sloop of war <em>Peuguin</em> at the Cape of Good
Hope when she touched there. She remained two days,
and then sailed, and was never heard of afterward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were passengers on the <em>Sultana</em>. After leaving
the cape she encountered heavy gales, and was driven
entirely out of her course and out of her reckoning, and
finally upon the reef of rocks below here, where she was
wrecked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great Heaven! And you were cast away here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And your fellow-voyagers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They were but too probably all lost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me the particulars.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin settled himself in his chair and told the tragic
story of the shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lieutenant listened with deep interest. He was
much too young a sailor to be very familiar with such
disasters.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the narrative was finished, and he had expressed
all the horror and the pity that was naturally inspired by
the tremendous calamity, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“But in the midst of all the desolation it was very fortunate
for you that the ship struck so high and fast between
the rocks, and held so long together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; it enabled us to save nearly all her cargo, provisions,
and even furniture and live stock,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a stupendous undertaking to remove them all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but it was successfully accomplished; and it enabled
us to establish ourselves comfortably here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed!” assented the young man, looking approvingly
around upon the pleasant room. “That was
more than two years ago. And you have lived here ever
since, quite isolated from the world?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And in all that time no ship has passed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! one ship! But of that hereafter. Tell me now,
lieutenant, how you come to be so far out of your course
as to touch this island?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are not out of our course. We are cruising about
these latitudes on the lookout for rebel privateers, as I
told you. We were just as likely to find one lying to in
your cove as anywhere else hereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“Just,” answered Justin, emphatically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we did not exactly come in here to look for them.
In fact, we suffered some injury from the gale last night,
and this morning we steered for this cove, that we might
be at anchor here while repairing. It was while we were
letting go the anchor that the captain, to his unbounded
astonishment, saw you and your companion on the beach.
He immediately sent a boat on shore to see who you could
possibly be; for, up to the moment at which we discovered
you, we had supposed the island to be entirely uninhabited.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, of course, you did not see our signal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Signal? What signal? Had you a signal?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have had a pennon flying from a staff at the
highest point of land on the island ever since we have
been here. We have renewed it from time to time during
the last two years. There it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where?” inquired the young man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There!” said Justin, going to the window and pointing
to the top of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there it certainly was not.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suspect that the wind made free with your flag of
distress, friend; for certainly not a vestige of it remains,”
said the young lieutenant, leaving the window
and retiring to his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith reappeared and laid the cloth, and spread the
table with coffee, rolls, butter, fried fish and broiled
chicken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is our luncheon hour,” said Justin; “draw up and
partake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young lieutenant frankly accepted the invitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>They gathered round the table, and while they ate
they talked of the war for the Union.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young officer gave his host a detailed account of
all those disastrous engagements that had followed the
first fatal field of Bull Run. But always he spoke hopefully
of the future. When luncheon was over the young
man arose and thanked his host and prepared to return
to his ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The captain will come on shore to see you, I am sure.
How long we may have to remain here for repairs I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>not know; a few days, I suppose; but when we sail, of
course, you and your party will go with us?” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course we shall, with your captain’s kind permission,”
replied Justin, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are not homeward bound, as I have already told
you. We are cruising in search of rebel privateers. We
may be some months longer in these latitudes, and we
may have a sea fight or so. Still I think, upon the whole,
your prospects will be better in going with us than in
staying here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Immeasurably better! Besides, we can stock your
storeroom with a large quantity of fresh provisions which
may be acceptable to your crew. And, if there should
be a ‘sea fight or so,’ as you say, why, I shall be happy
to take part in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Troth so shall I,” put in Judith, “if ye will put me
behind a safe place entirely, with a little hole convanient
for me to shoot through.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, Miss Riordan. You are another Moll
Pitcher,” replied the young man, laughing. Then, turning
to Justin, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why cannot you accompany me back to the ship?
Our captain, I know, will be very happy to see you. And
he would probably like to return on shore with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you, I should like very much to go on board
in person and invite your captain to visit us here. But
are you sure it will be convenient for you to carry me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Convenient for me to carry you? Why, certainly.
And not only convenient, but delightful. And not only
you, but you all. Will Miss Conyers honor us by making
one of the party?” said the young sailor, turning toward
Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you, Miss Conyers?” inquired Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks! no, I think not this morning. Some other
time,” answered the young lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, with a courteous bow, the young lieutenant lifted
his cap and left the house, accompanied by Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>They walked down the beach, where they found the
boat waiting. The young officer motioned Justin to precede
him, and then followed him into it.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the oarsmen took their oars, pushed off from the
land, and struck out for the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Five minutes of rapid rowing brought them alongside.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain stood on deck waiting to receive the
stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young lieutenant stepped on board, accompanied by
Justin, saluted his superior officer, and then presented his
companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Yetsom, Mr. Rosenthal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two gentlemen thus introduced to each other,
bowed somewhat informally.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wrecked from the <em>Sultana</em>, some two years since, and
cast, with two companions, on this desert island,” the
young officer went on to explain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord bless my soul alive! Come down into my cabin
and take a glass of wine,” said the captain, as if the
calamity had just then occurred, and the sufferer was in
immediate need of a restorative.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Yetsom was what might well be called a stout
man. He was of medium height, but thickly set and
solidly built, with a large head, broad shoulders, deep
chest and strong limbs. He had a florid complexion, blue
eyes and sandy hair and whiskers. He wore the undress
uniform of a captain in the United States Navy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come—come down into my cabin and take something
to drink. It will help you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, captain. I will go down into your <em>sanctum</em>
with pleasure; but as we have just risen from the luncheon
table, I do not require any refreshment,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense, man, you must need something to drink!
A glass of generous wine would set you up. Come down
and take—— Lord bless my life and soul, what a calamity!
Were they all lost?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All but three,” answered Justin, as he followed the
hospitable and obstinate sailor down into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there, over some rich old port, Justin had to tell
again the tale of the woeful shipwreck, and to hear again
the story of those fatal fields of Bethel, Manassas and
Ball’s Bluff.</p>

<p class='c007'>This talk wore away a good part of the afternoon; and
then Justin arose to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I came on board in the hope of persuading you to return
with me and spend the afternoon and evening at our
rustic dwelling,” said Justin, standing, cap in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“Not to-day. To-morrow, perhaps. We shall be here
three or four days, at least. The ship’s carpenter reports
our injuries from the late gale much more serious, or, at
least, more extensive, than we had supposed them to be.
He says it will take the best part of a week to get her
ready for sea again. When we sail I hope you will go
with us. I dare say you have no desire to colonize here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not the slightest. I and my companions in exile will
very gladly take passage with you,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I shall be very glad to have you. But mind! I
do not promise to take you home immediately. We may
have a bout or two with the rebel privateers first,” explained
the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘So mote it be!’ I should enjoy a bout or two with
the rebel privateers; and bear a hand in it as well as I
could.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll warrant you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now, captain, I have a large quantity of provisions,
consisting of live stock, fresh vegetables, fish,
eggs, fruits and so forth, which I would like to place at
your disposal,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I wouldn’t like to rob you of them! In fact, I
couldn’t think of doing so,” said the captain, while his
palate, almost pickled with a surfeit of salt food, fairly
watered at the mention of fresh meat and vegetables.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” said Justin, smiling, as he noticed this, “if we
are to be your passengers, where will be the robbery?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“True—I didn’t think of that! Surely it would do you
no good to leave all the fresh food here to go to loss after
you are gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not. Therefore, captain, if you can spare
any of your hands from duty on the ship, perhaps you had
better send them on shore to employ the days while you
remain here in taking the provisions on board.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly. That is good advice,” said the captain,
smacking his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And—I shall hope to see you and as many of your
officers as you please to bring, to dine with us to-morrow
at four.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes—thank you. We’ll come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will bid you good-afternoon, captain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ahem! I beg your pardon! Stop!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Justin stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Ethel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young lieutenant answered the call.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the boat ready to take Mr. Rosenthal on shore?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, ay, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will take leave of you,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ahem! wait one moment,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin waited.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ahem! Ahem! Ahem! You say that you have
plenty of fresh provisions over there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Plenty, captain; and they are heartily at your service,”
said Justin, suppressing a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beef?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I am sorry to say, not beef. We have but one
milch cow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s bad. Mutton?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Running; not killed. You see we never kill sheep at
this season, for one would spoil before we three could eat
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! that’s bad again. But a slaughtered sheep
wouldn’t spoil before we could eat it here on shipboard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shall have your choice of the flock to-morrow,
captain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; I will take it then. Have you chickens?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I am happy to say that we have chickens in our
larder already prepared to cook.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ahem! send me a pair for my supper by the boat
when it returns; there’s a good fellow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly, captain. It was my intention to do so,”
said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now I’ll not detain you, since I see you are in a
hurry to be off,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Justin bowed and left the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>On deck he found Lieutenant Ethel waiting to see him
on shore. And they entered the boat and were rowed
back to the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be so kind as to send one of your men with
me to take back a basket which I promised to send the
captain,” said Justin to Lieutenant Ethel, as the boat
touched the sands.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“Yes, certainly; go, Jones,” said the young officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the sailor to whom he gave the order arose and
followed Justin on shore and then up to the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then before even giving Britomarte an account of
his visit to the ship, he called Judith to bring a large covered
basket, and with his own hands he filled it with
chickens, eggs, fresh butter, cheese, milk, fruit and fish,
and gave it to Jones, directing him to take it with his
compliments to the captain of the <em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Jones touched his hat and went back to the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin passed into the parlor, where Britomarte, with
tea ready, waited for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Justin! what a joy to think that we shall leave
this lonely isle, and sail for our native land once more!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, an unutterable joy!” replied Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! what a change has a few hours brought about.
This morning, when we arose, we had no more idea of
being rescued from this island than we had had on any
day in the two years and a half that we have spent here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed! Let us thank the Lord for this great
deliverance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I do! I do!” said Britomarte, fervently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then a silence fell between them for a few minutes—a
silence which Britomarte at length broke by asking:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our prisoner, Justin—what about him? Have you
told the captain of him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not yet. I have concluded to defer all mention of
our prisoner until to-morrow, when the captain and his
officers are coming to dine with us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; that will be the best opportunity of introducing
the subject,” assented Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>After tea they spent the evening in planning for the
entertainment of the captain and the officers of the
<em>Xyphias</em>. And then they separated and retired to bed—not
to sleep, but to lie awake with the joy of thinking
about their voyage home.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br> <span class='c005'>THE PIRATE SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next morning was one of pleasant bustle in the
island home. The little household was astir early. And
directly after breakfast they went about preparing to receive
their company.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin went out with his tackle to the little creek making
up from the cove, where at this season he could catch
fine fish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte began to sweep and dust the parlor, and to
arrange the furniture and put fresh flowers in the vases.
These vases, by the way, were of wickerwork, woven by
Justin from the fibres of the palm leaves, and provided
with wooden cups hollowed out from blocks of palm logs,
to hold the water for the flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith, in the kitchen, was up to her eyes in pastry,
jelly and custard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure it is a blissing intirely that I was so saving of the
sugar, using the sweet sap from the canes in the swamp
as offen as iver I could to make it last. And a notable
favor iv Crummie not to go dhry. True for ye, ma’am,
wid the sugar, and the milk, and the eggs, and the fresh
fruit itself I can make a dessert fit for the royal family to
sit down to, let alone the dinner that will go before it, wid
fresh fish and ham, and roast chicken and pigeon pie.
And the idea iv our having company to dinner, ma’am.
Sure it’s in a dhrame I’m thinking I am all the time.
Plaise, ma’am, will ye be so good as to pinch me, to see
if I’m awake itself?” said Judith to Miss Conyers, who
had come into the kitchen for more water for her flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you think if you were to put your finger to the
hot stove, it would do as well, Judith?” laughed Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Faix, no, ma’am. I niver could abide a burn. And
troth if it is a dhrame itself, I don’t know as I care to
wake. To think I used to say, whin we came into this
new house, that if we had only one neighbor living
across the fields there some-ers, where we could go and
take tay oncet in a while, it would be pleasanter like.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>And sure now me words are coming thrue, for if we
haven’t a neighbor itself to come and take tay wid us,
we have a company iv gintlemen and officers coming to
dine wid us. Troth, it is a dhrame, sure enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers left Judith to her work and her wanderings
of fancy, and returned to the parlor to complete the
decorations of that pleasant room.</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by Justin returned with a large string of fresh
fish, which he took into the kitchen and handed over to
Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he left the kitchen, he met, coming out of the opposite
door, the pirate captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, you feel better to-day. You feel able to be up?”
said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Come in, I want a word with you,” said the
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin went into his bedroom, which, for the last two
days, had been almost entirely given up to the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” said Justin, taking a chair and seating himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said the prisoner, throwing himself into another
chair, “there is a Yankee man-of-war in the cove below.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The United States sloop of war <em>Xyphias</em>, commanded
by Captain Yetsom, is out there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Exactly. And the officers are all coming here to dine
to-day?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The captain, and as many officers as he can bring, are
coming.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Precisely. So I understood from the gabble of the
women flying past my door. Now I tell you what, Mr.
Rosenthal, I wish to surrender myself to the captain of
the <em>Xyphias</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will do well,” said Justin, with a feeling of intense
relief; “that will be your best possible course, and it
will save me from the distressing duty of delivering up a
man whom I have sheltered in his need and nursed in his
illness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And shaken and choked in his cups, and handcuffed
and locked up in his sleep, ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! ho!”
laughed the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was the monster who proclaimed himself a rebel
and a pirate, boasted himself a throat-cutter and a shipsinker,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>that I took care of in that way. Such a monster
was not to be let loose upon two helpless women, who
had not even the means of securely barricading their
doors against him,” calmly replied Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho! ho! Yes, when I’m in liquor
I’m always a monster by my own account. I have then a
mad delight in inspiring fear, horror and detestation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you must expect unpleasant consequences from
indulging in such a mad delight. But how could I know
then, how can I know now, whether you spoke the truth
of yourself or not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By my word of honor to the contrary, given in my
sober senses, if you choose to take it. If you do not, I
have no other way at hand to convince you. Did even
my mutinous crew accuse me of anything worse than
taking a little too much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then again, the lady saw through me better; but
it is true that women are keener sighted than we are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you not say all these things to me long ago?
If you had, your captivity would have been very much
ameliorated,” said Justin, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why? Can a brave man ask? Do you suppose that
I was going to explain and apologize and supplicate my
captor? I’ll tell you what, so far from that, if I could
have got loose I should have killed you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Or tried to do it, you mean. You used some bad
language on waking up and finding yourself fettered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I ‘cussed sum,’ as the darkies say; that’s a fact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you make now the explanations you have
withheld to your hurt for six months?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why again? Can a good man ask? It is because you
brought me in from the storm, struck the fetters from
my wrists, gave me your own clothes, laid me upon your
own bed, and nursed me like a brother. That’s the reason
why I have explained to you first. In any case, I should
have to give a true account of myself to the captain of the
<em>Xyphias</em>, to whom I intend to surrender.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you are not really what you reported yourself
to be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What exactly did I report myself to be—Captain
Kidd?” laughed the man.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“A pirate! throat-cutter! ship-burner!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha, ha, ha! Rebel I am, since you dub as such the
commanders of all Confederate privateers. But I never
cut a throat or burned a ship in my life! I never harmed
a woman or child in my life, or man either, for that matter,
except in fair fight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad to hear you say so. I hope you will be able
to convince Captain Yetsom of the truth of your statement.
You had better surrender to him as soon as he arrives.
I will give you an opportunity of doing so in the
parlor! After you have made your case clear to the captain,
I shall be glad to have you join us at dinner. There
is my wardrobe—a limited one, indeed—at your disposal.
All that can be expected of us Crusoes is cleanliness.
We have none of us swallow-tailed coats or kid
gloves to go to dinner in,” laughed Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you; they would be an inconvenience if we had
them, especially the kid gloves. Do you know when the
ship sails again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In three or four days. She is anchored here for repairs
of injuries received in the late gale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And your party goes with her, of course?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. We shouldn’t like to stay here and chance the
coming of another ship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whither goes she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cruising after privateers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“After privateers! I’ll be——” (and here the captain
swore a tremendous oath) “if I don’t hope she’ll overhaul
the <em>Sea Scourge</em>! That has turned pirate unquestionably,
and I should like to see all those mutinous rascals hung
in a row from the yard arms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The arms would break with their weight,” laughed
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then they’d be killed by the fall, and that would
be just as well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cheerful bustle of a numerous arrival startled Justin,
and with a nod to the rebel sailor, he left the room
and hurried to the hall door to receive his guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was the florid captain, the two lieutenants, the
chaplain, the surgeon, the doctor and the purser—a party
of six, come to dine with Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you do? how do you do?” said the captain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>heartily shaking Justin’s offered hands. “That pair of
fowls was delicious, I tell you; and the fish and eggs were
a fine addition to my breakfast this morning. Let me introduce
these gentlemen: the Rev. Mr. White, ship’s
chaplain; Lieutenant Ethel, you know; Lieutenant
Robins; Dr. Brown, ship’s surgeon; Mr. Bruce, ship’s
purser. Gentlemen, Mr. Rosenthal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having accomplished this introduction with a great
deal of ceremony, the captain, with his officers, followed
his host into the parlor, where there was another introduction—namely,
to Miss Conyers, who received the party
with graceful courtesy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now, Mr. Rosenthal,” said the captain, as soon as
they were all seated, “my men with the boat are down below
there waiting your orders concerning the shipping of
those provisions you talked of. If you will send one of
your hands to show them where they are, they will go to
work immediately.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You forget,” said Justin, smiling, “that I have no
hands but those with which nature has provided me. I
should not like to part with either of them. But, if you
will be good enough to excuse me for fifteen minutes, and
allow Miss Conyers to entertain you, I will go and show
the men where the provisions are stored, and set them to
work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do so, then, my young friend! Of course, we will excuse
you for so good a work,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin bowed and left the room. But, before leaving
the house, he put his head into the bedroom door and
looked to see if the rebel captain was ready for the interview
with the Union officer. He saw Captain Spear, with
his head in the wash-basin, engaged in a very much-needed
ablution.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be ready in fifteen minutes?” inquired
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, or in twenty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will come for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin hurried down to the beach where the boat was
waiting, called the men to follow him and took them to
the mountain grotto, where his provisions were stored;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>set them to work at its removal, and then went back to the
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found the rebel captain all ready to go in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will remain here a few minutes while I go to Captain
Yetsom and prepare him to see you. Remember that
he has not even heard of your presence here yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And my sudden appearance might kill him with joy!
Is that it? Well, go and break the news gently, Mr.
Rosenthal,” laughed the rebel, sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin went into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Back already!” exclaimed the jolly captain of the
<em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and I have some news to tell you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“News! what, on this place? It must be that Columbus
has discovered America, or the Dutch taken Holland.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; but it is that we have taken the captain of the
<em>Sea Scourge</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord bless my soul and body! man, are you mad?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, nor dreaming. We have taken the captain of the
<em>Sea Scourge</em>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Taken the captain of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>? We know
that he was reported cruising about in these latitudes,
lying in wait for East Indiamen; but we have seen nothing
of him; there was no <em>Sea Scourge</em> nor any other ship
in sight when we anchored here, or when we came
ashore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And yet we have the notorious sea rover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Spear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Spear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bosh, man, you are jesting with us! You mean that
you have him in his photograph, or something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; I mean that I have him in person.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then there must be some other play upon the words.
Have Spear personally present on this remote Indian isle!
You might as well boast that you have Davis here!—as
you may have in his ambrotype, just as you have Spear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I assure you that the captain of the <em>Sea Scourge</em> is on
this island, in this house, and waiting to surrender himself
to you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For Heaven’s sake, explain yourself! Read me the
answer to this riddle before my head goes!” said Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Yetsom, while his officers listened with the same sort of
curiosity they might have felt in an ingenious enigma, or
as if the case had been put to them in conundrum style,
as: “Why have we the captain of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>
here?” and they were trying to guess the answer, or expecting
one from the propounder of the question that
should set the room in a roar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will explain,” said Justin, and turning to Lieutenant
Ethel, he continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may remember, lieutenant, I told you yesterday,
in reply to an observation of yours, that the <em>Xyphias</em> had
not been the only ship which had passed here, in the two
years and a half we have spent on this island—that there
had been another ship?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I remember.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That other ship was the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, driven out of
her course by a furious gale. She came into our cove
sailing under the rebel flag, which greatly perplexed us, as
we had never seen or heard of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes? Well?” exclaimed the captain and several of
the officers, listening eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The captain landed here; brought us the first news of
the war which, you may judge, much astonished and
grieved us. He proclaimed himself a Confederate privateer,
sailing under letters of <em>marque</em> from his government.
He drank more brandy than was good for him,
and went to sleep on the floor. In the afternoon his crew
mutinied, deposed him from his command, put another
man in his place and sailed without him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good! Where did you say the fellow is now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On this island! in this house! He has been here ever
since he was abandoned by his ship, of course. He is
now ready to give himself up to you. You will treat him,
I hope, as a prisoner of war.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That, as it may be. I must see and question the fellow
first,” said the captain of the <em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin went out and returned, accompanied by Spear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prisoner walked straight up to the captain of the
<em>Xyphias</em>, whom he recognized by his uniform, saluted
him, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir, I am Captain Spear, of the Confederate ship <em>Sea
Scourge</em>. I surrender myself to you, claiming the usage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of a prisoner of war. If I had a sword I would hand it
over; but I have none.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br> <span class='c005'>LEAVING THE ISLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next day was a busy one to our islanders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin was engaged in packing up and sending off his
stores of fresh provisions to the ship. And the jolly boat
plied all day long between the ship and shore to transport
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte and Judith were employed in packing such
clothing, books and household effects as they meant to
take with them from the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been determined, in solemn consultation between
the three, that some of the live stock, some of the household
furniture, and even some of the provisions—such as
would be likely to keep for a length of time—should be
left on the island, in case any other ship should be
wrecked upon its rocks, or any other passengers cast away
upon its desolate shores.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the fields they turned loose a few sheep and pigs and
fowls.</p>

<p class='c007'>They would have left Crummie, the cow, too, but that
Judith raised such a howl as never had been heard from
her before, not even on the occasion of the shipwreck;
and vowed that to leave Crummie behind would break her
heart entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'>To comfort Judith, and, above all, to stop her deafening
howls, Britomarte promised that Crummie should go.
And Britomarte’s promise was her bond; and, moreover,
her word was law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day that our islanders spent in consulting, deciding
and packing, the officers of the <em>Xyphias</em> passed in preparing
for a great feast to be held on board the ship in
honor of their new acquaintances and in return for their
hospitality. And on the second day our islanders were invited
to partake of it. They went early, fared sumptuously,
passed a very pleasant day, and returned late at
night to their island home.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>The remaining days of the week were spent in repairing
the injuries of the ship and transporting the stores
from the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain of the <em>Xyphias</em> thought the ship would be
ready to sail on the following Monday.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Justin heard this, he invited the captain and all
the officers to come and spend Sunday—the last Sunday
and the last day on the island—at this house, to hold divine
service there.</p>

<p class='c007'>And early on Sunday morning, the parlor, now dismantled
of half its furniture, was converted into a temporary
chapel, and hymns were sung and prayers said and
sermons preached, both in the morning and in the afternoon.
The sermon in the morning was preached by the
ship’s chaplain; and in the afternoon by Mr. Rosenthal;
and the officers and the crew attended both services, and
the captain of the <em>Xyphias</em> slept comfortably in his seat
through both sermons; but let this be said for him—that
he would not have slept, or even winked, during a sea
fight, though it had lasted day and night.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the afternoon service was over, the crew and
some of the officers returned to the ship; but the captain
and others remained and spent the evening, and only left
at a late hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wind and tide favoring, they were to sail early in the
morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jolly boat was to be at the landing by sunrise to
take the last load of our friends’ effects to the ship. It
was then to return for Justin, Britomarte, Judith, Crummie
and the little dog.</p>

<p class='c007'>And though this was their last night on the lonely island
that they might never expect to revisit again, and
they were on the eve of embarking for their dear, native
land, and thoughts and feelings were busy alike with tender
regrets and joyful anticipations, yet—in consequence
of the bodily fatigue they had endured that day, they fell
asleep as soon as their heads had touched their pillows,
and slept profoundly until morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The daylight, creeping in at the windows, woke Justin
first.</p>

<p class='c007'>When breakfast was over they went to work at their
final preparations for departure.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>I said that they intended to leave the house with a portion
of the furniture, clothing and books, for the benefit
of any future shipwrecked sufferers who might possibly
be cast away upon the island.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Britomarte went into the bedroom, and made up the
beds, and tidied the washstands, and set the chairs
straight and closed the windows, and fastened the doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>And while she was doing that, Judith washed up all the
crockeryware and cooking utensils, and put them away in
the cupboards, and then she cleaned up the kitchen, and
put out the fire, and shut the windows and doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, Justin went into the parlor and set the
chairs, tables, lamps and vases straight, and laid a Bible, a
hymn book, an old copy of Shakespeare and an old
almanac, a slate-pencil and some paper, pens and ink upon
the book shelves. Then he fastened the windows and
doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, the three friends, having completed their work,
met in the front passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Troth,” said Judith, “whoever comes afther us can’t
say as we’re not good housekeepers; for sure they’ll find
everything convanient to their hands, so they will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No one answered the girl. But Justin, with a grave
face, summoned the two women to his side, and then, reverently
lifting his hat, returned thanks to Divine Providence
for their long preservation on the desert island, and
for their present happy deliverance, and invoked his blessing
on the isle they were leaving, that it might yet become
the cultivated and populous habitation of civilized and
Christian man, and on their own coming voyage, that it
might have a prosperous course and happy end.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then the three went out of the house, closing the
front door behind them, and taking their way to the
beach, followed by the faithful little dog. Justin carried
on his shoulder the last box, which came out of Britomarte’s
room, filled with combs, brushes, towels, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Down on the sands they found the boat waiting for
them under the command of Lieutenant Ethel, who, to
do them honor, had come in person to take them on
board.</p>

<p class='c007'>Crummie was already in the boat, to which she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>been enticed by Judith’s old device of a pail of “warrum
male and wather.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And now, with her nose in that delicious mess, she
remained quiet enough while the boat was still.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel stepped on shore, bowed profoundly
to Britomarte, and held out his hands to Mr. Rosenthal,
with a hearty:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope we have not kept you waiting,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a moment. We have only just got Mistress Cudd
in here,” laughed the young man, pointing to Crummie.</p>

<p class='c007'>They all then got into the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith went immediately and stood by the head of the
cow, with her hand on the creature’s neck, ready to
soothe and control her in case she should become frightened
and restive when the boat should begin to move.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Crummie had seen too many ups and downs in
this world to be disturbed by trifles, and so she made the
passage to the ship with great composure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br> <span class='c005'>THE CRUISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The captain of the <em>Xyphias</em> stood on deck to receive
his passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deck was a scene of great bustle, with the seamen
getting ready to make sail. Some were weighing anchor,
some loosing the topsails and courses, and others coiling
down the ropes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the crowd the captain led his passengers to
the head of the gang-ladder, and took them down below
to the gundeck where his own quarters were situated,
and he assigned them berths in his own cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte and her attendant had a stateroom to
themselves, and Justin had a share in the captain’s stateroom.
It appeared from all this that they were to be received
as the captain’s own guests, and have seats at his
private table as well as berths in his cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having introduced his guests to their new quarters,
the captain returned to his post on deck. And the noise
of getting under way roared and thundered overhead.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Britomarte and Judith went into their stateroom to
inspect it and lay aside the small parcels that they had
brought from the house in their hands. And then Britomarte
asked Justin to attend them up on deck that they
might watch their island as long as it should continue in
sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went up and stood in the stern of the ship, leaning
over the taffrail, and looking upon the island, until
the <em>Xyphias</em> began to heave and turn, and then, as the
wind filled her canvas, to sail away from the open sea.
They watched the lonely isle as it gradually receded from
their sight, until palm trees, rocks and caverns were mingled
in one undistinguishable maze of color—they
watched it until it dropped lower and lower down toward
the horizon—until its outline became confused with the
boundaries of sky and sea—and then they turned away.
Britomarte drew her veil to hide her fast-falling tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she lifted it again there was nothing around her
but the lonely sea and sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second day of their voyage was a pleasanter one
than the first, principally because the captain, having discovered
the temperate habits of his passengers, did not
insist upon their making five meals a day.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were steering for Cape Town, where the captain
hoped to anchor by the end of that current week.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We may meet a homeward-bound vessel there,” he
said; “if so, we will put you on board of her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is you who are now anxious to get rid of us, captain,”
said Miss Conyers, archly.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the jolly captain put on the air of a very much
injured man, and vowed that Miss Conyers did him great
wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ship was constantly on the lookout for rebel privateers,
and kept a man at the masthead day and night,
relieving him every two hours. But night followed day,
and day succeeded night, and still no sail of any sort was
to be seen on all the lonely sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, this was one of the happiest periods that
our three friends ever passed. The weather was charming,
the sky clear, the sea calm, the wind light, and the
ship flew on over the waters at the rate of ten knots an
hour. The ship’s captain and officers were all extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>pleasant companions, and unaffectedly glad to have these
guests along with them to break the monotony of their
sea life.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the continuance of the fine weather, the three
passengers spent every day on deck and every evening in
the captain’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Usually the captain, the chaplain, Justin and Britomarte
formed a party, and played a rubber or two of
whist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes, to vary the evening’s pastime, Miss Conyers
would exercise her talent for dramatic reading, and
on these latter occasions, all the officers that could be
spared from the deck would be invited into the captain’s
cabin to receive their share of the entertainment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes, also, Miss Conyers sang for her friends.
And this singing was perhaps the greatest treat she could
give them. A woman’s sweet voice caroling their favorite
songs on the blue water was a novelty and a delight indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus pleasantly passed the days until Saturday morning,
when they made Table Mount. And on Saturday
noon they anchored in Table Bay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin and Britomarte went on shore to call upon their
friends at Cape Town.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went first to the South African College, but
learned there that their old acquaintance, Professor Jack,
had gone to Europe to collect certain rare scientific
works for his library.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they went out to Silver Tree Villa to see their
esteemed friends the Burneys.</p>

<p class='c007'>They found the reverend doctor and his family at
home and in good health, but immeasurably astonished
and delighted to see Mr. Rosenthal and Miss Conyers,
for they had heard of the wreck of the <em>Sultana</em>, and had
supposed their young friends to have been lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>And next it was the turn of Justin and Britomarte to
be equally astonished and delighted, for they learned that
the lifeboat containing the missionary party, after drifting
about the ocean for several days, had been picked up by
a Dutch merchantman bound for the Cape of Good Hope,
and all the passengers rescued; that the Elys and the
Bretons had remained guests at Silver Tree Grove for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>month, during which subscriptions had been taken up in
all the churches to raise a fund for their relief, and at the
end of which, being entirely refitted out, they had sailed
in the East Indiaman <em>Djalma</em> for Calcutta, <em>en route</em> for
their distant field of missionary labor, where in due time
they had safely arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Burney was able to assure Miss Conyers that her
friends were well and doing well, for she heard from them
by every Indian mail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great was the surprise and joy of Justin and Britomarte
on hearing this news.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, after all, the crew of that boat must have relented
and taken the two men on board,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose when Captain McKenzie refused to leave
the ship he left room in the boat for one, and they managed
to make room for the other,” observed Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>They dined with the Burneys, but were obliged to decline
all further hospitality, as the length of their ship’s
stay at Cape Town was very uncertain.</p>

<p class='c007'>So they took an affectionate leave of their friends, and
returned on board the <em>Xyphias</em>, in good time for the captain’s
early supper table, which was spread with all the
luxuries to be obtained at Cape Town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have news of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>. She touched here on
the day before yesterday, remained a few hours to get in
wood and water, and also to pick up a few seamen, and
then she sailed again,” said the captain, as they sat down
to supper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where?” eagerly inquired Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“East and north. Going, no doubt, to meet returning
East Indiamen from Calcutta. We must go in pursuit of
her, and lose no time about it either. So, Mr. Rosenthal,
we sail with the first tide to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am rejoiced to hear it,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have caused inquiries to be made, and find that
there are no homeward-bound ships in the harbor. So
this young lady, I am selfishly glad to know, has no option
but to go on with us for the present,” added the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unless she prefers to accept the hospitality tendered
her by the Burneys; in which case she can remain at
Silver Tree Villa, and wait for a homeward-bound ship.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>What do you say, Miss Conyers?” inquired Justin, turning
toward her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say that, with the captain’s kind permission, I will
stay where I am,” replied Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so that matter was settled.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br> <span class='c005'>THE CHASE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With the first tide the next morning the ship sailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weather kept its promise and was very fine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ship steered northeast, flying before a fresh wind
at the rate of ten or eleven knots an hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>And all day long our passengers lounged upon the
deck, reading, promenading or chatting; and all the evening
they played whist in the captain’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>And day and night the captain kept a man at the masthead
on the lookout, and relieved him every two hours,
that his vigilance might not slacken.</p>

<p class='c007'>But days and nights went by and there was no sign of
the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, or any other ship, on all the lonely sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length one evening when the tropical full moon and
great stars made all the sky and sea almost as bright as
day, and the officers off duty were lounging on the deck,
and the captain and his party were playing whist in the
cabin, there came a cry from the man at the masthead:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sail ho!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It roused the officers on deck like the blast of a
trumpet does the war horse. They “snuffed the battle
afar off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It startled all the whist players in the cabin, except the
phlegmatic captain, who went on counting his points:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two by tricks and two by honors; and five before!
We’re nine to their nine, Miss Conyers. And now all
depends upon the odd trick. So we must look sharp!—I
knew we should overhaul her at last! Parson, it’s my
deal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But no one listened to the captain. Every one was
straining their ears to catch the voices from the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sail ho!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The cry rung through the night air like an alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“Where away?” called the officer of the forward watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“About three points off our weather bows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you make of her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t make her out yet!”</p>

<p class='c007'>While this bawling was going on aloft, the captain of
the ship sat quietly over his rubber of whist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently Lieutenant Ethel came below, touched his
cap, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you please, sir, we have made a strange sail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you make of her?” inquired the captain,
without ceasing to deal his cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can make nothing of her as yet, except that she
appears to have seen us and is running away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That proves her to be the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, or some other
pirate! Clap on all the sail we can carry, and chase!—— Diamonds!
Parson, it is your lead, and we are waiting
for you. Miss Conyers, look sharp! We are playing for
the odd trick,” said the captain, as he turned up the
trump and sorted his cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young lieutenant went on deck with his orders.
And soon the ship flew under the pressure of her sails.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain went on with his game, and played well;
and as none of his excited companions could give sufficient
attention to the business in hand fairly to compete
with him, he won the odd trick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve beat them in the rub, Miss Conyers. Shall we
try to beat them in another one?” inquired the captain,
as he gathered up the cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no! pray don’t! let us go up on deck and look
after the chase!” eagerly urged Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You!” exclaimed the captain, in laughing astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I!” answered Britomarte, as her eyes widened
and brightened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord bless my soul alive, here is a young lady as
eager for the fray as any of us?” laughed the captain.
“I’ll warrant you, when you get back to your native
country, if the war is not over, to take an active part
in it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That I shall!” answered Britomarte, emphatically.
And all the while she looked her eager impatience to get
upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“There is no necessity for haste, my dear young lady!
We shall see nothing when we get there—except what
we have seen for so many days and nights—an expanse
of sea and sky!” laughed the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the strange sail?” eagerly questioned our amazon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, the strange sail! You’ll not see her, at all
events! The men have made her out only through their
glasses! She is miles away! and we shall not overhaul
her before morning,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>And he set the watch and went below, and turned in for
a short nap, leaving Lieutenant Ethel to manage the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin stayed on deck a little while longer, and then
followed the captain’s example.</p>

<p class='c007'>But none of them, except the phlegmatic captain, rested
very well that night. The thought that they were chasing
a privateer, whom they would probably engage in battle
next morning, was not likely to rock them to sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte certainly never closed her eyes; she was
awake no less by her own excitement than by the “tireless
tongue” of Judith, who talked of nothing but the coming
fight and the share she would like to take in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, meself hopes they’ll find something for me to do
in it! Troth, if they’d put me to one iv the big guns, I
could fire it off wid the best iv them. And if they’d not
trust me to do that same, I could hand patridges as well
as the powdy monkeys thimselves!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cartridges, Judith,” said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, that’s what I’m maning! And, troth, I’ll find
something to do in it, or me name’s not Judy Riordan!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad and proud to see so much spirit in a sister
woman, Judith, whether you find an opportunity to exercising
it or not,” said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>At which Judith was so delighted that she went off
into another fit of boasting more extravagant than the
first.</p>

<p class='c007'>To have heard Judith talk then, you would have imagined
her to be Boadicea, Joan of Arc and Moll Pitcher
rolled into one.</p>

<p class='c007'>So passed the night in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just before the dawn of day, Lieutenant Ethel came
below to the captain and reported the chase within range
of their lee-bow gun.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Fire a blank cartridge into her,” said the captain, immediately
turning out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte and Judith overheard every word of this
short interview; and Judith clapped her hands for joy,
exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now they’re going to begin. Sure meself is happy as
Paddy at Dunnybrook Fair. And, oh! that I was up on
deck wid the seamen! Wouldn’t I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boom-m-me!” thundered the cannon over the sea, with
a report that shook the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a violent bound, Judith leaped up, clapped her
hands to her ears, and, shaking and screaming with the
extremity of terror, hid her head in Britomarte’s lap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, what’s the matter, Judith?” inquired Miss Conyers,
as the sound rolled away. “Is this your heroism?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“S’int Pater and all the Holy Apostles! Mother Mary
and all the blissid virgins!” gasped the panic-stricken girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boom-m-me!” roared an answering gun from the
chase.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ow-oo!” screeched Judith, burying her head in Britmarte’s
lap; “kiver me up! kiver me up! I’m kilt entirely!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Miss Conyers started up, threw the girl off her
knees, hurried on her clothes and hastened out into the
cabin, where she met Justin leaving his stateroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The action has commenced!” exclaimed Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, dearest one. Stay where you are, I beseech you.
You can do no good on deck,” urged Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I can do no good, I can at least risk my life with
the others,” persisted Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But to what end? Britomarte, you will not only do
no good by going on deck, but you will do much harm by
being in everybody’s way,” said Justin, bluntly.</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked intently in his face to see if he spoke in
earnest, before she answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that is so, I will stay here. But oh, how unwillingly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And she sat down, only half resigned to her inactivity,
and mediated how she could change it into good service.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they spoke, another shot was exchanged between
the ships.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin hurried up on deck.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Everything there was in admirable order. None of the
confusion that too often precedes an engagement appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deck was cleared for action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men were all at their quarters, the officers at their
posts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain was standing on the quarter-deck, leveling
his glass at the chase, which was, moreover, in full sight
about two miles ahead.</p>

<p class='c007'>The firing ceased for the time being.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the meaning of this lull, captain?” respectfully
inquired Justin Rosenthal, coming to the side of
Captain Yetsom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sailors will swear, more is the pity, and Captain Yetsom,
dropping the telescope to his side, blew off a tremendous
oath, under the impression that he had a sufficient
provocation to do so, and then he added:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are on a false scent, sir; we have been chasing an
English ship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you certain?” doubtingly inquired Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! these infernal pirates sometimes show false
colors. This is what has happened, Mr. Rosenthal.
When I came up on deck I found her within good range
of our lee-bow chaser. I ran up the Stars and Stripes
and sent a blank cartridge into her by way of a visiting
card. She returned the compliment by firing a salute
from her stern-chaser; but did not show her colors, and
did not cease to run.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sent a more urgent message to her in the form of a
round shot from our lee-bow chaser. She returned the
fire in kind and hoisted the English Union Jack.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But didn’t heave to?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, nor cease to run away from us. Whatever she
does, she does not cease to run.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But an English ship, or an honest ship, scarcely would
do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Scarcely. And that is what makes the affair doubtful
and awkward. If she is an English ship we have no business
to pursue her; but if she is a rebel privateer sailing
under English colors we must take her.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>While the captain spoke, Mr. Rosenthal had been attentively
regarding the chase. Now he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The longer I look at that ship, the more familiar she
seems to me. Will you lend me your telescope, captain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Yetsom handed the glass and waited the result
of Justin’s inspection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin pointed the instrument and took deliberate sight
at the chase. He viewed it attentively for a minute and
then returned the telescope to the owner, saying quietly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not on a false scent, captain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh? What do you make of her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The <em>Sea Scourge</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you quite certain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite. I cannot be mistaken. Indeed, I recognized
her by naked eye from her general appearance. And
when I brought the glass to bear upon her, I knew her
also by individual marks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain of the <em>Xyphias</em> waited to hear no more.
He laid down his telescope, sprang upon the poop deck,
and drew out his speaking trumpet.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the men had scarcely taken their eyes off their captain
during the fifteen minutes of suspense in which they
stood idly at their quarters, there was no need to call their
attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain put the speaking trumpet to his lips, and
thundered forth the words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lads! the prize that we have been seeking, the
<em>Sea Scourge</em>, is before us. And please Heaven she shall
be ours before night!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tremendous cheers from the seamen responded to the
captain’s pithy speech, and proved their good will to the
work before them, and their confidence of victory.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br> <span class='c005'>THE FLIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Stand to your guns men!” thundered the captain of
the <em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the deafening cheers sank into silence, and the
<a id='t260'></a>order was promptly obeyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Ethel!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>The young lieutenant came quickly at the captain’s
call.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pass the order to fire at the enemy’s mizzen mast.
Strike at as low as possible; for the lower you carry it
away the more unmanageable the <em>Sea Scourge</em> will become.
The heavy press of sail she carries forward will
then lift her stern high out of the water and render her
less obedient to her helm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, ay, sir!” responded the cheerful voice of the
young officer, as he touched his cap and went forward to
see the order executed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gunner in charge of the lee-bow chaser was an old
and experienced one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lieutenant gave him the order, word for word, as
he had received it from the captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll try, sir,” said the veteran, with a confident smile
and pat on the breech of his gun, which satisfied the lieutenant
that the gunner knew his business. The gun was
now ready. He sighted her, and gave the command:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fire!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Out poured the deafening discharge, and two hundred
pairs of eyes were tracking the course of the ball through
the air, each in impatient suspense to see the effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>It struck close under the stern of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A good shot! a capital shot!” exclaimed the captain.
“A little more elevation on your next, and you will splinter
his mizzen mast!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Lieutenant Ethel raised his telescope and
took sight at the chase. And it seemed that the captain
of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, finding that his false colors did not
protect him, and having a ball drop so close under his
stern, concluded that he was known, and determined to
fight the battle out under his true ones. Down fluttered
St. George’s Cross and up flew the Stars and Bars. And
the next instant his stern chaser answered the iron messenger
from the <em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shot plunged into the sea close on the weather
quarter of our gallant ship, doing no other harm than
copiously sprinkling the jolly tars on that side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A free shower bath in hot weather is a pleasant and
a wholesome thing!” exclaimed a young midshipman,
who had received his full share of that blessing.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>But another good fellow, a landsman recently shipped
from Cape Town, who had been standing gaping and
staring with mouth and eyes open, received a deluge on
his face and chest, striking him with such a shock that he
lost his balance and his reason at the same moment, and
fell flat upon his back, rolling over and over, imagining
that the ball had struck him, and that the water gurgling
back from his throat was his own lifeblood, and bawling
at the top of his voice:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m shot! I’m shot! My head’s off! My head’s off!
Take me down! Take me down!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Amid roars of laughter from his companions, an old
salt caught up a pair of shell hooks, similar in shape to
fire tongs, and, reaching forward, brought the ends together
over a piece of flesh under the fellow’s pantaloons
with an unmerciful squeeze.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dead man sprang up with wonderful agility, and,
amid piercing shrieks, bawled out:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m shot again! I’m shot again! Take me down below!
Take me down below!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such peals of laughter followed this that the lad
opened his eyes, looked about, came to his senses and
realized his position.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the captain’s command he went forward and slunk
out of sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next shot from the <em>Sea Scourge</em> took off the head
of the brave old salt, spiraling it round and round until
it struck the deck, while the headless body sank quivering
down upon the very spot where but a moment before
the form of the coward had rolled.</p>

<p class='c007'>But—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The coward dies many deaths,</div>
      <div class='line'>The brave man dies but once.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Shot after shot was now exchanged between the ships
with little effect; the <em>Xyphias</em> all the while gradually
drawing nearer the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, and the chase growing
more exciting.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length a lucky shot from the <em>Xyphias</em> struck the
enemy’s mizzen mast, just above the mizzen top, and
down came the wreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cheers upon cheers went up from the crew of the
<em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Yells of defiance answered them from the decks of the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel again leveled his glass at the chase.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Sea Scourge</em> still minded her helm, as her spanker
and crotchet were still standing and drawing. The
wreck of her mizzen mast was promptly cleared away.
And she doggedly answered gun for gun, shot for shot,
though the <em>Xyphias</em> was now gaining rapidly upon her,
and her case was well-nigh hopeless.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last a shot from the <em>Xyphias</em> struck the taffrail of
the enemy, close by the wheel, scattering the splinters in
every direction. One struck the helmsman, driven to
his very heart. In his death agony and delirium he
clutched the spokes of the wheel with the grasp that
could not be loosened, and he slowly sank windward to
the deck, turning the wheel with him. The <em>Sea Scourge</em>,
in obedience to her helm, rounded sharply to the wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seeing his ship broaching to, the captain of the <em>Sea
Scourge</em> ran aft, yelling:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What d’ye mean by that, you —— sea cook? Luff!
Luff!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There came no response from the helmsman; and indeed
in the same instant that he ceased speaking the captain
perceived that the man was past hearing. He
reached the helm too late. The ship was already taken
aback and lying directly across the course of the
<em>Xyphias</em>, and not two cables’ length from her. He gave
the helm to a seaman near, and, springing upon the poop
deck, yelled forth the order:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rake her with your port battery!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then issued forth a tremendous discharge that shook
the privateer from masthead to keel, so that she trembled
like a living creature struck with palsy. Then he braced
her yards and put her wheel hard down, so as to bring
her again upon her course.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, from the deck of the <em>Xyphias</em>, Captain
Yetsom, observing the privateer in the act of broaching
to, first looked, expecting to see her haul down her colors.
But as they continued to fly, he put up his helm to
clear the <em>Xyphias</em> from the raking fire that he foresaw
would be poured into her from the port battery of the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>But so quickly did the <em>Sea Scourge</em> broach to, that the
<em>Xyphias</em> could not get away in time, and so she received
the enemy’s whole broadside obliquely over her lee bows,
with disastrous effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The roar of the cannon, the crash of falling timbers
and the shrieks of the wounded were appalling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many poor fellows lost their lives and many more
their limbs.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now, above all the noise and confusion, the voice
of Captain Yetsom rang out clearly and firmly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Man the starboard guns! Clew up the courses!
And so we cross the privateer’s bows, take good aim and
pay her well for this!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And before the <em>Sea Scourge</em> could veer round upon her
course again, the <em>Xyphias</em> came across her bows. A long
line of fire belched forth from the starboard guns, sending
iron missiles crashing and tearing into the <em>Sea Scourge</em>,
and dealing death and destruction everywhere among her
crew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here Justin’s clear and ringing voice was heard high
above all others in the cheers that rose heavenward from
the deck of the <em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again these cheers were answered with yells of defiance
from the deck of the privateer, whose sails now began
to fill rapidly, so that she quickly wore round.</p>

<p class='c007'>This brought the ships opposite to each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now commenced a murderous exchange of broadsides.
Roar followed roar! Crash came upon crash! The
shrieks of the wounded on both sides mingled with each
other and with the cheers of their unhurt companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin was everywhere—inspiring the brave to still
greater deeds of valor, encouraging the faint-hearted till
they outrivaled the most heroic, helping all by precept
and example, and serving at the guns where men had
fallen, until relieved.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now the foremast of the <em>Sea Scourge</em> was seen to
totter and fall!</p>

<p class='c007'>While the enemy was encumbered with this wreck,
Captain Yetsom set his courses and, shooting ahead, took
up a raking position, from which he poured into the <em>Sea
Scourge</em> a galling fire of grape and canister.</p>

<p class='c007'>The privateer persistently returned the fire with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>bow chasers, and promptly cleared her deck from the
wreck of the foremast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Yetsom, seeing that with the indomitable courage
of his countrymen she would sink before she would
surrender and seeing also that she was manœuvring to
get into position again, determined to carry her by the
board.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood off for a short time and gathered his officers
and men about him and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That privateer is well fought. Her commander will
go to the bottom with her colors flying, rather than haul
them down. He cannot have many men remaining fit for
duty. So, to save the lives of my men, as well as that
ship and her crew, I am resolved, by the help of the Lord,
to carry her by the board.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This announcement was received with tremendous
cheers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enough! To your quarters, men!” thundered the
captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The order was immediately obeyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Ethel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young lieutenant sprang to his captain’s side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get ready the boarding party!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ethel sprang to execute his order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Yetsom then put his ship about, and as
she came in collision with the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, poured into
the enemy a broadside from her port battery, and then,
cutlass in hand, leaped on board, followed by Justin and
the whole boarding party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here they were met by a set of men, few in number,
but desperate in resolution, and a terrible conflict ensued.
Foremost among the boarding party might have been
seen the tall form of Justin, cheering on the men and
striking good blows for the flag he loved so well.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, what was Britomarte doing? Where
Justin had left her, she had sat studying what she might
do to help the good cause. Suddenly she found out her
mission.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There will be wounded men,” she said, “and no one
to attend to them in the excitement of the action.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And she arose and opened her trunks and boxes, and
took from them all the soft old linen she could find, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>sat down to tear it into bandages, and having done that,
she began to pick the shreds that were left into lint.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Britomarte was engaged in this humane work,
her panic-stricken companion lay in one of the berths,
with her head under the cover, trying to deafen herself to
the sound of the battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the shrieks and groans of the wounded and dying
began to mingle with the roar of cannon and the
crash of timbers, then Britomarte gathered up her linen
bandages and lint, and put them in a little basket with a
pair of scissors, a flat knife, and needles and thread, and
with the basket on her arm, she went up on deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everybody was too busy there to see or stop her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the black and sulphurous smoke, through
pools of blood, between dead bodies, heedless of the
cannon balls that tore crashing past her, she made her
way to that part of the deck where the ship’s surgeon
stood among the wounded, having them carefully carried
below.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doctor, I have come to take care of these brave fellows,”
she said, pausing at his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The surgeon looked at her in dismay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Young lady, for Heaven’s sake——” he began; but
she took the word from his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doctor, for Heaven’s sake forget that I am a ‘young
lady,’ and look upon me only as a human being, able and
willing to be useful!” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boom-oom-me! crash! splash!” came the cannon ball
from the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, tearing its way over their heads,
and dropping into the sea before them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte stood like a statue, absolutely unshaken by
the tremendous shock.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were you not frightened?” asked the doctor, in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; why should I be?” she coolly demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, why should you not be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the first place, because I have no fear of death; in
the second, because I have no great love of life. If I
could feel fear, I should rush to the very front of danger
to cure myself of the weakness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe you would. You are formed of the metal of
which heroes are made!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“Let me help you,” said Britomarte, feeling impatient
of his praise, and pointing to the basket of linen bandages
and lint that she carried in her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, my child, you can help me, and you may. And
at least you had better be down below with me binding up
wounds, than up on deck with the gunners helping to
make them, as I think was your first aspiration,” replied
the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Britomarte, “I should like to serve at one
of the guns, but since I am not permitted to do so, I am
willing to be useful in any other way. And you will find
that I shall not dress our brave sailor’s wounds any the
less tenderly because I should prefer to make wounds for
other people to dress on the bodies of the foemen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And saying these words, she followed the doctor down
into the cockpit, where the wounded lay, some in hammocks,
some on sail cloth, and some on the naked planks.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there her courage, her humanity, and, above all,
her divine purity, so impressed the ship’s surgeon, that
he did utterly forget that she was a young lady, and he
made her as useful as if she had been a medical student.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the surgeon’s orders, with her sharp scissors and
steady hand she ripped up the sleeves of the sailors’
wounded arms, or the trousers of their wounded legs,
with equal promptness. She cut sticking plaster into
long, slender slips, and watched the doctor to see how he
brought the gaping lips of mere flesh wounds together,
and closed them, by laying across them, at right angles,
these delicate strips of plaster, and then bandaged them
up with linen.</p>

<p class='c007'>She watched him perform this simple operation once.
And then she assured him that she could do that as well
as he could. And after that, while the surgeon attended
to the more serious cases—probing wounds, extracting
balls, and even amputating limbs—Britomarte closed and
bandaged all the simple flesh wounds with a skill equal
to that of the surgeon himself, and with a tenderness that
drew from her rough patients many thanks and blessings.</p>

<p class='c007'>And all this time the roar of battle went on overhead
and all around her. Occasionally a ball struck near.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, however, the cannonading ceased, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>noise and confusion of another sort was heard above—a
mighty cheering and hurrahing and running to and fro.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What does that mean?” exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>But nobody could answer him, and he was too busy
with his wounded to go and see for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte had dressed the last wound of her last
patient, and was holding a glass of brandy and water to
his lips, for he was faint from the loss of blood, when
another injured man—a young midshipman—was
brought down.</p>

<p class='c007'>And he reported that the captain had resolved to carry
the enemy by the board.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that brave young fellow, Mr. Rosenthal, is foremost
among the boarding party, fighting like another
Paul Jones,” he added.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte listened breathlessly; but waited quietly until
her patient had drained the glass that she held to his
lips, and then she gently laid his head back, put down
the glass, and rushed up on deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>She reached that horrible deck—the scene of the late
carnage. It was slippery with human gore, and spattered
with brains, and littered with the splinters of shivered
timbers and shreds of rent canvas, and fragments of
broken weapons, and obstructed with dead bodies; and
over all hung a sulphurous smoke of gunpowder that
obscured the vision and blackened all the sails and rigging;
and above all rang the clash of steel, the report of
firearms, the screams of the wounded, and the yells and
cheers of the combatants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through all these horrors Britomarte rushed to the
starboard side of the ship to which the <em>Sea Scourge</em> had
been clawed up so closely that any one might easily pass
from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the deck of the <em>Sea Scourge</em> the battle was raging
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first, her senses all bewildered with horror, Britomarte
perceived before her only a pandemonium of clanging,
clashing, thundering, smoking, blazing, bleeding,
screaming, yelling chaos! But presently her straining
eyes made out the figure of Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conspicuous above all the rest by his great height and
strength, and by the grandeur of his inspired countenance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>which seemed as that of a god of war, and flinging
himself wherever the fight was fiercest, he soon became
the one target of the enemy, who struck at him from all
sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seeing him thus surrounded and desperately fighting,
Britomarte clasped her hands, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Heavenly Father protect him! In Thine infinite
mercy protect him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, no longer able to restrain herself, on seeing him
in the most imminent peril, she caught up a cutlass from
an arm-chest near, and crying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, God of battles! give strength to my weak
woman’s arm this day!” she rushed over to the deck of
the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, in the midst of that hell of war, and
stood by her lover’s side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Justin had singled out the pirate Captain
Mulligan as his own; and also Mulligan, who was a brave
man, had sought out the mighty champion of the
<em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>And at the moment in which our amazon, cutlass in
hand, boarded the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, these two met; and Justin’s
other assailants fell back at a signal from their captain.
And now, between the two, stroke followed stroke
in rapid succession, each very adroitly parried. At
length Mulligan lost his temper, and with that his presence
of mind, and made a fierce lunge at his adversary’s
heart, which was quickly parried, and before he could
come to his guard again, Justin brought down a crushing
stroke upon his head that felled him to the deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>But as he was in the act of leveling this fatal blow, he
caught a glimpse of a seaman with a cocked pistol
pointed close to his head. He thought that his time had
come; he mentally prayed that his soul might be received
in heaven; he heard the report of the pistol, felt the ball
whizz through his hair, and thanking the Lord for his
preservation, he turned and saw—what? The seaman’s
pistol arm resting on the cutlass with which Britomarte
had struck it up!</p>

<p class='c007'>To her, then, he owed his life. But there was not an
instant of time to think of that now. Quick as lightning
his arm flew up and his steel fell, crunching through the
brain of the seaman, who dropped lifeless to the deck.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Every act in this passage of arms passed with the rapidity
of thought. There was not more than a minute occupied
in the felling of Mulligan, the aiming of the pistol, the
striking it up by Britomarte, and the braining of the
assassin by Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now heedless of the battle storm that raged around
them, Justin dropped upon one knee, as a knight before
his queen, and, seizing the hand of his beloved, he exclaimed
with deep emotion:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I owe my life to you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have owed mine many times to you. Thank
Heaven that you are saved!”</p>

<p class='c007'>After the fall of their captain was known to them, the
pirate crew submitted, crying for quarter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Sea Scourge</em> was now the prize of the <em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>And down came the Stars and Bars, and up ran the
glorious old flag!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br> <span class='c005'>VICTORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As soon as the crew of the <em>Sea Scourge</em> had surrendered,
Captain Yetsom ordered them below and closed
the hatches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he detailed a small party of his own men and
placed them under the command of Midshipman Bestor,
to take charge of the prize, and ordered the others to
their own ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as he regained the deck of the <em>Xyphias</em> he
sent for Lieutenant Ethel, and passed down into his
cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>A strange weakness, dizziness and dimness of sight
was creeping over him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, what is this?” he said to himself. “It cannot
be from that scratch! Bosh! I must get a glass of
brandy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the act of crossing to his locker, he turned
giddy, reeled, grasped at the nearest object for support,
and then fell forward upon his face to the cabin floor in
a deep swoon.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>At that very moment Lieutenant Ethel was in the act
of coming down the companion ladder.</p>

<p class='c007'>He instantly ran to his assistance, exclaiming anxiously:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain! what is the matter? Are you ill?—wounded?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Receiving no answer he placed his hands under his
captain’s arms to lift him up, and in doing so perceived
that his coat was saturated with some warm glutinous
matter. Instantly withdrawing his hands for examination,
he found them covered with thick blood. In serious
alarm now, he turned the captain and drew him gently to
a spot where the fresh air could blow upon him, and then
he ran to the head of the companion ladder, and, calling
to the sentinel stationed near, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Scribner, pass the word to the cockpit that the captain
requires the presence of the surgeon immediately in his
cabin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ethel, for his part, rushed back to the side of the captain
and began rapidly to unbutton his coat and vest. When
he came to his underclothing he found it crimson with
blood, that had flowed so freely as even partially to fill the
space between his top-boots and the limbs they covered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young lieutenant groaned in anguish of spirit, for
he loved his captain as man seldom loves man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The surgeon now came down the companion ladder.
Seeing Ethel bending over the prostrate form of the captain
and tearing away the blood-stained clothing, he
rushed forward, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s all this? What’s the matter? The captain
wounded? Good Lord! he is one clot of blood! In
Heaven’s name, sir, why was I not told before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I came in here but a moment ago and found him lying
flat on his face,” replied the young man, in a heartbroken
voice. “Oh, doctor, is he dying?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope and trust not. He has fainted from loss of
blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I loved him as a father! he was so good, so kind! Oh,
doctor, is he wounded mortally?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can I tell until I examine the wound? Here,
take hold of this sleeve of his undershirt while I take the
other. Now draw gently. There’s the wound. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>what a wound! I fear it is all over with our poor captain!
Come, Ethel! stop that! This is no time for blubbering
like a woman, my boy! A minute, as we use or
waste it, may save or lose our captain’s life. Here, take
the water in this basin and gently swab the blood away
from that wound, which I perceive has nearly stopped
bleeding, while I run for my instruments,” said the doctor,
rushing out of the cabin as fast as his fat legs could
carry him.</p>

<p class='c007'>No braver man than young Ethel had boarded the <em>Sea
Scourge</em> that day; yet, as soon as the doctor was gone, he
burst into sobs that shook his whole frame; and his fast-falling
tears mingled freely with the water with which he
washed his captain’s wound. He did his work as tenderly
and as thoroughly as possible, and had perfectly cleansed
the wound by the time the doctor returned. And even to
the young man’s unprofessional eye the wound looked less
formidable than at first.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor got down upon his knees and made a very
careful examination, and then he lifted his head and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven! it is not near so bad as I had expected
to find it! It is an ugly flesh wound at worst, and he’ll
weather it. You see, a pistol ball has entered here on his
right side and furrowed its way clear across the chest,
and come out under the left arm. No wonder he bled so
much. But he could bear it. He could bear it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>While the doctor spoke he lost no time; he was busy
cutting long, slim strips of sticking plaster, with which he
gradually brought the ragged edges of the wound together,
securing them by laying the strips at right angles
with the length of the wound, and then carefully bandaging.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this was done, with young Ethel’s assistance, he
washed his patient thoroughly, put fresh clothes on him
and laid him on his bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly the doctor administered restoratives, that soon
brought the captain to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>On recovering his consciousness, Captain Yetsom
looked languidly around, and, finding himself upon his
bed, and, seeing Dr. Brown and Lieutenant Ethel bending
anxiously over him, he feebly inquired:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“Why am I here? What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have been wounded, but not seriously. You
fainted from loss of blood and fell upon your cabin floor.
Lieutenant Ethel found you and called me. And we have
dressed your wound, and undressed you and put you to
bed, where you are to remain for the present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The captain writhed and frowned. Of all things he
abhorred to lie inactive in bed at this crisis. But he
recognized the truth of the doctor’s words, and he submitted
to necessity; the more readily because he felt that
the few words he had spoken had already exhausted him.
He rested to recover a little strength, and then he beckoned
young Ethel to stoop close to his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Ethel,” he whispered, “you will take command of
both ships. See the prisoners secured according to your
best judgment. Make all necessary repairs. Then—shape
for Cape Town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having with difficulty given these orders, Captain Yetsom
turned his face to the wall, and, from sheer exhaustion
fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Brown and Lieutenant Ethel left the cabin. The
doctor went to attend to his other cases. The lieutenant
hastened to attend to the important duties that now devolved
upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime, where were our two young friends, and
what were they about? Justin and Britomarte had returned
to the <em>Xyphias</em> with the officers and crew. As
soon as the general congratulations upon the victory were
over, Justin walked apart with Britomarte, and taking
her unresisting hand in his, looked upon it with intense
affection for a while, and then, in a low and earnest voice,
he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have gloriously redeemed your word, my sister.
You have borne a heroic part in this engagement. You
have passed where the cannonading has been heaviest,
and you have risked your life in the thickest of the fight!
But thank God—oh, forever and forever thank God that
this white hand has been raised only to save and to heal,
and not to slay!”</p>

<p class='c007'>His voice, his whole frame so shook with emotion as
he uttered these last words, that she caught the contagion
and dropped her head upon his shoulder and burst into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>tears. He drew her closer to his heart and leaned over
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rough sailors passing near saw all this, but they
had long ago set this pair down as betrothed lovers, and
their only feeling was of sympathy with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By ganny!” said one gray old sea dog as he passed,
“if I could find a gal as spunky as that one, I’d spark her
myself, old as I am!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin bent over Britomarte, delicately soothing her,
more by looks and touch than by words. At last he
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know—can you imagine, dearest, how deeply,
doubly grateful I am to Divine Providence that it is to
you I owe my life? A good gift is always precious, but
more precious from those we love, and more precious
from the one we love most!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother Justin,” she said, raising her head and smiling
through her tears, “do not make more of this matter
than it really is. I, too, am deeply grateful that I was
enabled to save one who first saved me, and who for two
long years toiled hard to keep me from starvation on
that desert island. Say no more about that, brother; but
oh! devoutly thank God with me that he has protected
you through all the dangers of this dreadful day!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do—I do, Britomarte! that He has protected, not
me alone, but us, for you have been throughout in as
great danger as any here. Oh, Heaven! when I think of
that I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother Justin,” interrupted Britomarte, recovering
her old tone, “whatever we do, don’t let us grow sentimental.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will not. But this I will say, and you must hear:
By one of the most heroic acts that man or woman ever
dared, at the most imminent risk of your own life, you
have saved mine. But I tell you now, Britomarte Conyers,
that the life you have saved is worthless, and worse
than worthless to me, unless you will allow me to devote
it henceforth and forever to you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again his voice and his whole frame shook with the
intensity of his emotions. She, too, was deeply agitated;
but with a queenly effort she regained the sovereignty
over herself and answered gravely:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“I am ashamed of you, brother Justin. That sentiment
was quite unworthy of the mighty champion of the
<em>Xyphias</em>, who carried terror into the hearts of the <em>Sea
Scourgers</em>. Devote your life to God and to his suffering
humanity, and leave me to do the same.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And she was about to leave him to return to her
wounded in the cockpit, when something in his aspect,
that was not sentiment, or passion, or anything like either,
alarmed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin—brother! how ill you look! What is the matter?
Is it possible that you are wounded?” she breathlessly
demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fatigued, dear sister, fatigued.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you are so pale?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you not seen me as pale as this after a day’s
work on the island?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sometimes, when the weather was very warm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, the work has been very warm to-day. Never
heed me, sister. A little rest will set me all right, and
then I shall be able to give some assistance to the officers,
until they reduce this chaos to order again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Very slowly and reluctantly Britomarte left him, and
went down into the cockpit to send a messenger to look
for Judith, while she herself gave her services to the
wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as Britomarte was out of sight, Justin tottered
to the nearest gun carriage, and sat down upon it, utterly
unable to move a step further.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the hand to hand fight on board the <em>Sea Scourge</em>,
he had been half conscious of receiving a wound, though
in the excitement of battle he had paid no attention to it;
but when the fight was over and the excitement subsided,
he was made fully aware, by a sharp pain under his right
arm, and a trickling sensation, that he was wounded and
bleeding. Even then, not wishing to part with Britomarte,
he had retained her at his side until an approaching
faintness warned him that to save her from the
knowledge of his condition, he must let her go. Therefore
he spoke of Judith, that Britomarte might go in
search of her, and give him the opportunity to look to
his wound. His lifeblood was flowing fast away, his
strength was failing him, yet he gave no utterance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>suffering, lest he should distress her whom he loved more
than life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that she had left him, it was with a sigh of intense
relief he sank down upon his rude seat. He felt that he
had not power to reach his cabin, and that he must look
to his wound as he sat.</p>

<p class='c007'>He called to a seaman passing near, and desired his
assistance. He also sent word to the sentry at the cabin
door not to let the women out until he should give the
word.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, with the help of the seaman, he took off his
clothes and came to the wound.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not a severe one, though it had bled so freely.
He had been struck from behind with some long, sharp
weapon that had entered near the armpit, passed through
the flesh of the right side, and come out through the skin
near the breast bone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other sailors, seeing Justin stripped to his waist
and covered with blood, came running to him with expressions
of alarm and sympathy, for by his bravery and
kindness he had become a general favorite.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were all vociferous in their demands for the surgeon.
But Justin checked them with a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My good friends,” he said, “there are many poor fellows
who need the surgeon much more than I do; let
him attend to them first.” And then he sent a cabin boy
for some water, towels, and clean clothes from his stateroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment Lieutenant Ethel came out of the
cabin. Seeing the men grouped idly around the gun
carriage, he came up to order them to their duties, when,
perceiving the state of Justin, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good Heaven, Mr. Rosenthal! You wounded, too?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but very slightly. Give yourself no uneasiness,
lieutenant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has the surgeon been sent for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, and pray do not send for him. Leave him to attend
to the poor fellows who need him more than I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I insist upon sending for him. All our badly injured
men have been looked to. And now that I see
your hurt is not the trifle you would make it out to be.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Here, Jones, go down to the cockpit and desire the surgeon
to come up at once. Men, to your duties!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The messenger went on his errand. The seamen dispersed
at the order. And soon the good doctor came.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! Mr. Rosenthal wounded? I thought it hardly
possible for you to have escaped, if all were true that I
had heard of you. Not badly hurt, I hope? Let me see!
This fellow had struck at you from behind, and with a
dagger, too. May Satan fly away with the cowardly
assassin! If he can be identified, he ought to be
hanged!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind him now! I don’t care to have him
identified. And I don’t think the wound severe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it is not severe! A few days’ rest and regimen
will set you all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor soon closed the wound, and then told Justin
to lean on his arm while he led him to his stateroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Justin asked the doctor first to send down to the
cabin, and get the women out upon some pretence, as he
did not wish to distress Miss Conyers with needless
fears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Conyers! Why, bless you, my dear fellow, I
left Miss Conyers in the cockpit, hovering like an angel
of mercy over the poor wounded sailors there, ministering
to their wants, alleviating their sufferings and bringing
smiles to faces that before her coming had been
wrung with anguish! She is a lovely woman,” said the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven knows she is,” responded Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor now supported his patient to the stateroom,
laid him in the berth, and after a few moments left him
in a refreshing sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br> <span class='c005'>EXPIATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Among the killed on board the <em>Xyphias</em> was Captain
Spear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether it had been owing to his long enforced abstinence
from his bane, strong drink, or to the long hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>of solitude giving him ample time for reflection on the
desert island, or to earlier and holier associations revived,
or to all these influences combined, I do not know;
but it is certain that a gradual change for the better had
been stealing over this man for some time before the sea
fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to the day of the engagement he had had the freedom
of the ship. On that day, however, in the beginning
of the action, Captain Yetsom, meeting him on deck, had
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know how hard it is for a brave man to be cooped
up in his quarters while a battle is going on; but prudential
considerations oblige me to send you to yours.
Were you at large here, unforeseen accidents might place
it in your power to do us much injury.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Yetsom,” said Spear, speaking earnestly and
seeking to meet the eye of the commander of the
<em>Xyphias</em>, “if you will give me the freedom of your deck
during this engagement, I promise you upon my sacred
honor that I will take no part in it against you or for
your enemy. I owe the dogs who deserted me no love
or service, Heaven knows! And even should circumstance
place it in my power to harm you, or aid them, I
will do neither. I swear it in the hearing of high
Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Yetsom looked into the eyes that had been
seeking his so earnestly, and saw in them such good
faith as won his confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well—I will trust you,” he said, and hurried off to
his duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spear had promised no more than this.</p>

<p class='c007'>All through the exciting chase he had remained a
silent, inactive spectator, brooding mournfully over—what?</p>

<p class='c007'>Officers and men, passing rapidly on their hurried errands,
sometimes glanced at this sombre figure like a
statue there, and wondered carelessly what his thoughts
and feelings might be.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what were they in truth? Who could tell? Was
his love for the old flag stealing over him? Did he remember
how his father, now in his grave, had sailed and
served under it for more than forty well-spent years?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>How that brave and patriotic father had taught him to
love and honor it as the emblem of his nation, the safeguard
of liberty, the <em>ægis</em> under which the oppressed of
all the earth found or hoped to find protection? Or did
he remember his own stainless and promising youth
when he had been the pride of his father, the joy of his
mother, the idol of his brothers and sisters, and the very
life’s life of her, the fair one, dearer than all the rest,
who was to have been his wife, but from whom the sins
of his manhood had utterly divided him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ah, seduced by evil counselors, misled by specious arguments,
tempted by ambition, and weakened by that
growing vice, he had suffered himself to be drawn in and
hurried down into that malebogle, in which so many
brave, misguided spirits perished! He had deserted the
old Flag—he had raised his hand against it!</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot speak here with assurance, for I gathered these
antecedents of this man from another source than his lips;
but I think it must have been memories like these that
caused the sobs and tears that shook his broad chest and
flowed down his bronzed cheeks as he stood again under
the old Flag, among the men who were fighting for it.
I say no one could read his heart or tell his thoughts and
feelings; but many saw his actions and heard the few
words he uttered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God have mercy on me, what have I been doing?
God forgive me, for I have been mad, I think!”</p>

<p class='c007'>While he had been standing thus absorbed, entranced,
by the memories of the past and the pains of the present,
the storm of battle had been gathering all around him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ships had been manœuvring and were now abreast
of each other, pouring in their broadsides.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tremendous crash of the reports aroused him. He
started up, his eyes kindled with a new resolution, and he
watched his opportunity to put it in practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>It came. He saw a brave gunner fall. He sprang to
fill his place, and served the gun until he was relieved.
After that he threw himself into the action with all his
soul, now serving a gun that was short handed, now, cap
in hand, cheering on the men. He drew attention from
all. Many a brave old soldier, in the midst of the battle,
found time to grasp his hand, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“You are one of us still, God bless you!” or words to
that effect. One earnest old gunner of the order of men
who prayed and fought, gave him a grip, exclaiming, with
more cordiality than coherence:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘There is more joy in Heaven over one,’ <em>et cetera</em>, and
‘go thou and do likewise.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>On seeing his zeal and devotion, Justin found time once
to dart to his side and say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heaven bless you for your noble example! I had
done you injustice in the past! Forgive me now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did me no injustice, Mr. Rosenthal. I had given
you too much reason by word and deed to think the
worst of me. I was never so evil as I made myself out to
be, however; though evil of late have been my days.
Enough! that is past! And I am offering up my life in
expiation now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was indeed. He never shrank from duty or from
danger. And, not ten minutes after these words had left
his lips, a cannon ball from the enemy struck and cut him
in two. And thus at last was his promise to his dying
father grandly redeemed.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return from this episode.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel, on leaving Justin, ordered the forehold
of the <em>Xyphias</em> to be prepared to receive the prisoners.
Then he mustered his men under arms, passed
over to the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, ordered the hatches to be taken
off and the prisoners to come up on deck.</p>

<p class='c007'>One hundred and nineteen men responded to the call,
and were all marched to their place of confinement, with
the exception of the officers, who were furnished quarters
with the officers of the <em>Xyphias</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the prisoners were secured, a portion of the
ship’s company were set to putting the <em>Xyphias</em> in order.
The decks were swabbed, the rigging righted, and all
traces of the late conflict so effectually removed that she
began again to look like one of our tidy men-of-war, and
not like a cross between a shipwreck and a butcher’s
shambles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel, with the surgeon and another portion
of the crew, went over to the <em>Sea Scourge</em> to attend
to her remaining wounded and to put her to rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>The injured men on the upper deck having been already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>removed and relieved, the lieutenant and the surgeon
passed at once to the lower deck, where a sight of horror
met their eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wounded, dying and dead lay scattered thickly
around. The groans of the living were more appalling
than the ghastliness of the dying or the dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>All that were still breathing were at once tenderly removed
to the cockpit, where the surgeon of the <em>Xyphias</em>,
assisted by the surgeon of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, dressed their
wounds, administered opiates, or in other ways sought to
alleviate their sufferings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Body after body of the dead was brought up, sewed in a
sail-cloth winding sheet, with a weight at head and foot,
and solemnly consigned to the deep to remain until that
dread day when “the sea shall give up its dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This sacred duty having been performed, the deck was
swabbed and put in as good order as circumstances would
admit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The carpenter now reported that he had plugged all the
shot-holes of both ships under or near the water lines, and
sounded their pumps, and that neither of them now gained
any more water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel then ordered that the further repairs
needed by both vessels should be continued by watches
both day and night, so that the benefit of the present
calm might not be lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then he went below and turned in to take the rest
he so much needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte, on leaving Justin, had gone, as I said, down
into the cockpit to look after her own especial cases
among the wounded, and also to dispatch a messenger in
search of Judith. An hour passed away, during which
Britomarte had ministered to the wants of all her patients,
and at the end of which her messenger returned
without any news of Judith, who was nowhere to be
found.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers now felt seriously alarmed lest some fatal
accident had happened to the girl, or lest she, in her delirium
of terror, had cast herself into the sea. In the
midst of this anxiety, however, it occurred to her that at
the cessation of the cannonading Judith might have returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>to the cabin. With this hope Britomarte returned
thither.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had scarcely reached the foot of the companion
ladder, when she thought she heard a groan coming from
the direction of the stateroom occupied in common by
herself and Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>She hurried thither and opened the door, and there lay
the girl tossing and moaning in high fever, brought on by
excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lorrd bless you, ma’am, is it yerself sure? Troth I
thought you had forgot me entirely, and left me here to
perish alone. Faix I’m burning up, so I am. May the
divil fly away wid all say fights, for this has been the
death iv me, so it has. Sure, I’m murthered complately
from head to fut. And you left me to me fate, so you
did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, Judith! You must be quiet, or you will grow
worse. Try to compose yourself now, while I go and get
something that will do you good,” said Miss Conyers, laying
a towel wet with cold water upon the girl’s burning
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she went in search of a surgeon and procured an
opiate, which she administered to her patient. Then she
renewed the wet towel, rearranged the disordered bed,
darkened the room and left Judith to repose. If any of my
readers imagine this portrait of Judith to be overdrawn,
I can assure them it is not. I knew this girl for years.
She was just the “medley of contraries”—the mixture of
wit and folly, good sense and absurdity, spirit and cowardice,
selfishness and self-devotion, that I represent her
to have been. I lost her, and could have better spared a
better.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the cabin Miss Conyers returned to the cockpit,
to her wounded, bringing smiles to the faces of the poor
sufferers, as she tenderly eased their positions, turned
their pillow, bathed their faces and hands, or held cooling
drinks to their feverish lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was while Britomarte was engaged in this humane
work, that the surgeon was summoned on the upper deck.
But little did she imagine that he was called to attend
Justin or that Justin had the slightest need of his care.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte did not confine her attentions to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>wounded on the <em>Xyphias</em>. But when she had done all
she could for them she visited the <em>Sea Scourge</em> and ministered
to the sufferers there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning the repairs upon the <em>Xyphias</em> were
completed, so that she was once more in good fighting
order.</p>

<p class='c007'>The men were then transferred to the <em>Sea Scourge</em> to
expedite the work there. Lieutenant Ethel found the
decks of the prize clean and sweet, the wounded men in
their hammocks, and the work progressing so rapidly
that the privateer would be fit for sailing in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte, worn out by her arduous labors of the day
before, slept very late that morning; and upon entering
the cabin she found that the breakfast had been long set.
She was very hungry, but not knowing the condition of
her companions, she patiently waited for their appearance,
only wondering at their prolonged absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the steward entered the cabin, and she inquired
what detained the gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man, forewarned not to alarm her, answered that
neither Captain Yetsom nor Mr. Rosenthal had risen yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Britomarte, amazed at their self-indulgence and unsuspicious
of their true state, breakfasted alone, and then
took in a cup of tea and a round of toast to Judith, whose
fever was now gone, but who still kept her bed from
the weakness of reaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finding still that her companions did not appear, she
became uneasy and went to seek the surgeon and inquire
of him the true reason of their absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Brown informed her that they were both
wounded, though not dangerously; and that he had ordered
both of them to keep quiet for a day or two.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My Brother Justin wounded! And I not know it until
now! Oh, Dr. Brown, I must go to him at once!”
she exclaimed, in excessive agitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Miss Conyers, you must not—you of all persons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I will go! Who shall hinder me? And why
should I not? Why shouldn’t I, who have attended so
many wounded seamen who had no claims upon me but
those of common humanity, go and wait on my own——”
her voice broke down in tears.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>—“Sweetheart?” said the doctor, archly, finishing her
sentence in his own way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir! my own soul’s brother!” flashed Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ask you why I may not minister to my brother, as I
have ministered to scores of strangers?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because your presence would agitate him as it could
not possibly agitate strangers. He must be kept quiet to-day.
His wound is not a dangerous one, as it is now, but
there are incident upon even slight wounds such things
as irritative fevers, which are bad, and erysipelas, which
is worse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte sank down upon a coil of rope and covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now don’t do that! You, the ‘Battle Queen’ of yesterday,
to give way to-day because your—ahem! well!
brother, since you will have it, brother—is wounded! I
tell you his wound is not dangerous, scarcely serious.
The worst of it is he concealed it too long. He concealed
it until every other case was attended to—noble fellow!
Now see here! I told you of what might possibly happen
in case he should be excited, only to prove to you how
necessary it is that he should be quiet. Now I will tell
you what I will do with you. I will promise that if he is
kept still to-day, he shall see you for a few minutes to-morrow
or next day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Britomarte was too much agitated to trust herself
to speak. She started up, hurried to her stateroom, flung
herself upon her berth and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin wounded,” she sobbed, “and concealing his
wound from all others until even the humblest sufferer
was served! And concealing it even from me, to save
me pain! How patient, how noble, how self-sacrificing
he always is! Justin wounded! and ah! much more seriously
than the doctor will admit. And if he should die!
disappear from the earth forever! I could not live on it!
I could not! Heavenly Father, spare him and save me
this dread trial that I could not bear!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Yes, truly, the “Battle Queen” of yesterday was a weeping
woman to-day!</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning, on waking, both Captain Yetsom and
Mr. Rosenthal found themselves much better, though still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>so heavily oppressed with languor and weariness that they
dozed away the whole day, indifferent to all that was going
on around them and unconscious almost even of their
own existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte again breakfasted alone, feeling very miserable.
She had never realized so keenly how vitally necessary
to her happiness Justin’s presence was. And she
was not permitted to see him that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the forenoon Judith came out of her
stateroom, cross and sulky, and muttering maledictions
upon the sea, the ships, the guns, and most things in general.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile the calm still continued and the works on
the prize were all but finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the third morning our two wounded friends were
very much better.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin especially, whose hurt was the least severe, felt
his strength so much revived, and his wish to see Britomarte
so urgent, that in the afternoon he arose and
dressed himself and crept out into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte was seated with her elbow resting upon the
center-table, and her forehead bowed upon her hands in
deep thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin came quietly to her side, and resting his hand
upon the table, whispered softly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Like a deer she sprang up, her hands extended, her
whole face beaming with joy, as she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Justin! I am so glad to see you! I have missed
you so much! I wished to go and nurse you, but the
doctor would not allow it. How is your wound? And
oh! why did you conceal it from me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Britomarte, I did not wish to distress you with
groundless anxieties. My injury was slight. I am nearly
well now; and I am more than repaid for my short confinement
by the welcome you give me. But yourself? I
hear that you have been a sister of mercy among the
wounded. How have you borne the trial?” he inquired,
looking down upon her with infinite tenderness and solicitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have borne everything well, except your wound and
your concealment of it from me. Oh, Justin!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Well, well, dear sister, I am all right now—quite
right,” he answered, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>But even as he spoke she saw his lips grow white, and
a film pass over his eyes, but she governed her alarm, and
said gently:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin, you must lie down—there on the sofa; hush!
you must not speak. I will help you there, and I will get
a book and sit down by you and read to you, but if you
attempt to talk I will leave you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I submit myself to you, my gentle nurse,” said
Justin, willingly enough obeying her mandate, for he felt
that he was not strong enough to sit up, or self-denying
enough to leave Britomarte’s company.</p>

<p class='c007'>So she led him to the sofa and eased him gently down
upon it, and arranged the cushions under his head and
chest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she drew a chair to his side, and sat down to read
to him. Her right hand held the book on her lap, her
left hand lay softly on his forehead. She read purposely
in a low, monotonous tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently, as if her touch and tone were mesmeric, his
eyes grew heavy, then closed. She shut her book, and
continued to watch him until gradually her head drooped
lower and lower, until her forehead rested on the arm of
the sofa, and her beautiful, heavy, dark hair, slipping
from its fastening, fell down and mingled with the auburn
curls that shaded his pale forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both were asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Judith came in and found them so. She stood contemplating
them a few minutes, and then her Irish enthusiasm
burst forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Och, sure, what a beautiful picter entirely. It’s like
the babes in the woods, so it is, or Adam and Ave in the
garden iv Aden, before the sarpint entered it. Sure it’s
made for aich other they are, the darlints. Troth meself
wonders the chaplain did not marry thim out iv hand, the
jewels. Faix it’s a pair iv slaping beauties they are, the
angels. And meself will sit down and guard thim.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Judith drew a chair up to the sofa, and set herself
squarely before them, losing all consciousness of her own
pains, injuries and misadventures, in the satisfaction with
which she contemplated this picture of beauty and repose.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br> <span class='c005'>A GHOST APPEARS TO JUDITH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The ships were now both repaired as well as they could
be at sea. Passed Midshipman Bestor was placed upon
the <em>Sea Scourge</em> with a prize crew, and ordered to sail
when the <em>Xyphias</em> should, and if possible, to keep her always
in view, or if he should lose sight of her, to shape
for Cape Town and meet her there. The prisoners were
then divided, half of them being sent back to the <em>Sea
Scourge</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>By eight bells every preparation was completed for sailing.
But there was no wind. A dead calm still prevailed.
All that night and the next day it continued. But on the
ensuing morning, just before dawn, Lieutenant Ethel was
awakened, and notified that the wind was rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sprang up and hurried on deck, where he found the
men all alert, and in the highest spirits. And soon both
ships were bounding on their course.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this day everything went on smoothly; wind and
weather favored them; the ships kept in consort, and no
unpleasant event occurred to mar the prosperity of the
voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin, under Britomarte’s fostering care, rapidly improved.
It was strange to see with what a motherly tenderness
and solicitude this young girl guarded and guided
the sick man who was at least ten or twelve years her
elder. She would not permit him to overexert himself
in any way; she forestalled all his needs; she walked with
him, sang to him, and amused his waking hours or
soothed him to repose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poor Justin! this was a great joy and a great trial to
him. He idolized her, but he was forbidden to tell her so.
He was in raptures and he was in despair. He considered
himself the happiest man alive, and he wished himself
at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstand which he got well so fast under Britomarte’s
fostering care, that on the seventh day from his
sailing his name was stricken from the sick list.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Captain Yetsom also improved very rapidly under the
skillful treatment of the surgeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the tenth day, at night, every one was awakened
by the lusty cry:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Land ho!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And on the morning of the eleventh, coming on deck,
they found themselves anchored in Table Bay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the captain announced that they should remain
for twenty-four hours, as he had to see the American consul,
and parole a portion of his prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these circumstances, Justin and Britomarte, taking
Judith with them, went into Cape Town, and spent
the day with their hospitable friends, the Burneys, at
Silver Tree Villa.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime Captain Yetsom, who had now resumed
command of his ship, went on shore, and made
arrangements with the American consul there concerning
the prisoners of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, who he proposed should
be paroled and put ashore at Cape Town. This measure,
when made known to the prisoners, was met by different
individuals in different ways. Some among them who
were vagrants belonging to no particular country, such
as might be picked up at any seaport to serve under any
flag, were willing enough to be turned loose at Cape
Town, where they would be sure to find employment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Others, chiefly American and Irish, rather than be left
in a foreign port, were willing to take the oath of allegiance
to their own or their adopted government, and to
ship as seamen on board the <em>Xyphias</em>, which, by reason of
the large number killed and wounded, was now short
handed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Others again were neither willing to remain at Cape
Town nor to take service on the <em>Xyphias</em>, and they earnestly
exclaimed against the enormity of Captain Yetsom’s
cruelty in turning them loose upon a foreign shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Captain Yetsom, when he good naturedly condescended
to notice these grumbling remonstrances, answered them
in a few words: “Military, or rather naval necessity!”
The <em>Xyphias</em>, going on her cruise after more privateers,
could not be encumbered with prisoners—could not be
converted into a floating gaol; and the prisoners could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>be trusted on the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, which was to be sent
home.</p>

<p class='c007'>So these malcontents were left with the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prisoners thus disposed of, Captain Yetsom turned
his attention to other and equally important matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>He relieved Passed Midshipman Bestor of his charge,
and ordered Lieutenant Ethel to take command of the
prize to take her home to New York. He reinforced the
crew of the prize with some of the best seamen from the
<em>Xyphias</em>, and he wrote his dispatches to the Secretary of
the Navy, describing the capture of the privateer, praising
the conduct of his officers and crew, especially recommending
Lieutenant Ethel for promotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte, Justin and Judith were to go home on the
prize. So on the afternoon of that day all their luggage
was transferred from the cabin of the <em>Xyphias</em> to the
quarters prepared for them on the <em>Sea Scourge</em>. But they
themselves, yielding no less to their own inclinations than
to the solicitations of the captain, determined to remain
with their friends on the man-of-war all that night, and
up to the hour of sailing the next morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very early the next morning all was cheerful bustle on
both ships, making ready to sail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel came on board the <em>Xyphias</em> to receive
his captain’s last orders, and then immediately returned to
the <em>Sea Scourge</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>But not until the last hour, when the sails were set and
the anchor was weighed, did Britomarte and Justin take
a last leave of Captain Yetsom and his officers, and amid
many mutual good wishes leave the deck of the <em>Xyphias</em>
for the yawl boat that was to take them to the <em>Sea
Scourge</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>When all was ready for sailing, the two vessels fired
their signal guns and stood out to sea, the <em>Xyphias</em> shaping
her course to the northeast, and the <em>Sea Scourge</em> to
the northwest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte, Justin and Judith stood in the stern of the
<em>Sea Scourge</em>, leaning over the taffrail, and watching the
<em>Xyphias</em> as long as she continued in sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>On board the <em>Xyphias</em> the doctor and the chaplain stood
in a similar position watching them. At intervals Captain
Yetsom appeared with the other two, and waved his hat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>to his friends on the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, and was answered by
the waving handkerchiefs of our party.</p>

<p class='c007'>And this was kept up long after they failed to distinguish
each other’s faces, and until the ships themselves
were out of each other’s sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>One evening, about the fifth day from that on which
they left the Cape, Lieutenant Ethel, Justin, Britomarte
and a young midshipman were seated around the cabin
table engaged in a rubber of whist, when they were all
startled by piercing shrieks, followed immediately by the
form of the girl, who came pitching, tumbling and rolling
down the companion ladder, and fell upon the cabin floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the company around the table sprang up simultaneously.
And Justin rushed to Judith and raised her
up, while Britomarte eagerly inquired what the matter
was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it’s the ghost! the ghost!” gasped Judith, beside
herself with terror.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What ghost, girl? Are you mad?” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, the ghost iv me swateheart, sure!” sobbed Judith,
white and shaking in her panic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense,” laughed Justin; “ghost, indeed! I’d like
to see one, for once. What does a ghost look like, Judith?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Och, a raw head and bloody bones it was! Ow-oo!
Ow-ootch!” she screamed, covering up her face and falling
into spasms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give her some brandy,” suggested the young midshipman.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Lieutenant Ethel called the steward, and had a
glass of brandy brought immediately and poured down
her throat. It seemed to do her good. They set her back
in an armchair, and Britomarte said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Judith, tell us what alarms you so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lorrd bless ye, ain’t I afther telling yez? It was the
ghost, sure—the ghost iv me gay Tom, as was dhrowned
in the dape say more’n two wears ago!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ghost of Foretop Tom! Judith, you were
dreaming!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Faix, I wish it was a dhrame itself. But I was wide
awake, sure, sitting at the head iv the ladher there, and
gazing at a great star, and wondering how far it was off,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and what it would be like if one could take howld iv it.
And sure I got tired iv that, and I riz up, so I did, and
seeing there was none iv thim bastes iv saymen about, I
thought I’d take a turn on the deck. And sure I hadn’t
walked tin steps afore, happening to rise my head, there
I saw the ghost iv me gay Tom standing right foreninst
me own two looking eyes. Ow-oo! Ow-ootch!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush, Judith; don’t scream so. Tell me what he
looked like,” said Miss Conyers, convinced in her own
mind that the girl had been dreaming.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Troth, ain’t I afther telling yez before? Sure a raw
head and bloody bones he was! Thin as a skillippin!
pale as a spicter! and tall as the mainmast, wid a white
linen cloth bound round his head, and his right fut tied
up in a rag! and his left arm in a sling! and he a-laning
on a crutch!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judith, it was one of the convalescent wounded men
you saw.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Divil a bit! It was the ghost iv me own Foretop Tom.
Sure wouldn’t I know it when I saw it standing there
forninst me own two looking eyes! And didn’t I like to
die wid the fright? And didn’t I wish the ship would
open and let me down into the say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did it speak to you, Judith?” laughed Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Spake to me? Lorrd help ye! do you think I was
going to wait there for it to spake to me? No, I ran down
into the cabin here as fast as me hales would bring me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you think the ghost wanted of you, Judith?”
inquired Lieutenant Ethel.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was an unlucky question for Judith’s equanimity.
It set her speculating in horrors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What it wanted iv me, is it? Ah, Lorrd kape us, who
can tell! Maybe to warn me iv another shipwreck, whin
we would all be dhrowned. Or another say fight, whin
we should all be murthered. Or at laste of me own
death itself. Sure a ghost nivir appears for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never,” said Lieutenant Ethel, mischievously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ow-oo! Ow-ootch!” screamed Judith, falling into
fresh spasms.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it became necessary to give her more brandy. And
then Miss Conyers coaxed her off into her stateroom and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>made her go to bed, and sat with her until, under the influence
of the brandy she had taken, Judith fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What could have frightened her so?” inquired Miss
Conyers, as she came out into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was as you suggested, either a dream of the figure
of one of our convalescent wounded men, I suppose,” said
young Ethel.</p>

<p class='c007'>And this explanation seemed so plausible that it was
adopted by all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have very little good of your attendant, I fear,
Miss Conyers. Since I have known her she has certainly
been more trouble than use,” said the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte laughed and answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is because since you have known her she has
been in circumstances to draw out all the faults of her
character. No one is perfect. But Judith would be a
treasure if it were not for her absurd fears—fears of
everything—beasts, guns, ghosts—what not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Saying which Miss Conyers sat down to the table and
they finished the rubber of whist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning, under the influence of the cheerful sunlight,
Judith herself was half inclined to laugh at her own
superstitious terrors of the preceding night, and to admit
that she might have been dreaming or deceived by an
accidental likeness. But when evening came again she
kept closely in the cabin, and nothing would induce her
to leave it.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the next afternoon, being the third day from the
first appearance of the mysterious visitor, Miss Conyers
left Judith engaged in tidying the cabin, and went up on
deck to sit and read. She had not been there more than
ten minutes when, with piercing shrieks and streaming
hair and wild eyes, Judith came flying toward her and
dropped at her feet, and buried her face in her lap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the name of Heaven, Judith, what is the matter
now? Are you really going mad?” exclaimed Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It appeared to me again! It appeared to me again!”
screamed the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ghost! It looked in at me through the cabin
windys! It had its head tied up in a cloth again and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>arm in a sling! I know its come to warn me in me
death! I know it has!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judith! you will drive me out of my wits if you go on
so. Be quiet,” said Miss Conyers, sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ow-oo! Ow-ootch!” screamed Judith, clasping
Britomarte firmly, and burying her head in her lap.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers beckoned a cabin boy who was passing
by, and sent him to ask Mr. Rosenthal to come to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>And when Justin obeyed the summons, Britomarte
pointed to Judith and said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has seen the ghost again, and is senseless and
helpless with terror. Assist me to take her down into the
cabin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With an impatient shrug of his shoulders, Justin complied
with the request. And they took Judith down and
laid her on the berth of her stateroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is worse than useless to be dosing this girl with
brandy. We shall teach her to drink. Go and bring me
a glass of cold water,” said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>And when Justin brought it she made Judith swallow
it all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can ail the girl, Justin? Is she losing her reason,
do you think?” impatiently inquired Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think she labors under an optical illusion, incident
upon an abnormal condition of the nervous system. She
has an excessively nervous temperament, which has been
severely tried in the last fortnight,” answered Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I must try to have patience with her,” smiled
Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Judith did not get over her panic till the next
morning, and then several days passed without a re-appearance
of the ghost or the illusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length one evening when the moon was bright, Miss
Conyers, instead of going down into her cabin, sat in
the stern enjoying the beauty of the night; and presently
feeling chilly, she told Judith to go to her stateroom and
fetch a shawl.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl started to obey; but the next minute uttered a
terrific shriek.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers sprang to her feet; and there, not three
yards from her, stood Judith, struck, statue-still, with terror,
gazing upon—what?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>A figure just as she had described the apparition to
be—thin as a skeleton, pale as a spectre; and if not as
tall as the mainmast, certainly looking preternaturally tall
from being so preternaturally lean; his head was bound
up in a white cloth, his foot tied up in a rag, his arm in
a sling, and himself leaning on a crutch;—the ghost of
that Foretop Tom who had been drowned more than two
years ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>An icy chill of superstitious horror, that all her will and
intellect could not prevent, shot through the veins of
Britomarte Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the next instant she had governed this feeling; and
saying to herself, “I will find out what this means,” she
walked straight up to the figure and laid her hand on its
shoulder.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XL.<br> <span class='c005'>HOMEWARD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Who are you, man?” inquired Miss Conyers, looking
in the face of the mysterious stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me? Ou, I’m just naebody!” answered the apparition,
rather sulkily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just Tam McAlpine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Foretop Tom!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, just himsel’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers sank down upon a coil of ropes, and
drew the trembling Irish girl to her side, and then said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have surprised me very much, and you have terrified
this girl nearly out of her senses, but I am glad to
know that you were saved from the wreck;” then turning
to her agitated companion, she said, “Judith, you see it
is Tom himself. Why don’t you speak to him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure I see it now. And I’ll spake whin I’m able. I
can’t yit!” sobbed Judith, covering her face with her
apron, and rocking herself to and fro.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, that will be the way she has treated me ever sin’
I foregathered wi’ her on the deck. Screeching and rinning
fra me as if I had been Auld Nick!” complained the
Scotchman.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“No wonder. We all thought that you were drowned
more than two years ago. And she took you for your
own ghost. How were you saved?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“E’en by a miracle—nae less. When the boat capsized
I laid hold of an empty cask, and whilk buoyed me up all
night until the tide turned, when I was floated far out to
sea. I gave mysel’ up for lost, but held on to the cask till
my strength was weel nigh spent. At length I was seen
and picked up by the ither lifeboat, whilk had been beating
about all that time. Three days after, when our bread
and water was nearly gane, our boat was picked up by an
outward bound Dutch merchantman, and we were saved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An almost miraculous preservation, indeed. You
must have been astonished to see Judith here. Our preservation
was quite as strange as your own.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, and I might e’en ha’ ta’en the lass Judith for a
ghaist, if I hadna’ been tauld by the sailor lads of the
castaways lost from the <em>Sultana</em>, and ta’en off the Desert
Island by their captain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, then you were prepared to see us,” laughed Miss
Conyers. “But still, I don’t see how you should be here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was taken prisoner from the <em>Sea Scourge</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, ye were, were ye, ye born divil!” exclaimed Judith,
uncovering her face, and speaking for the first time.
“And so ye turned pirate and murtherer, did ye? Troth,
I’d rather ye’ed been dhrowned in the say, so I had, than
ye should have turned cutthroat on me hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay! that’s the way she’s guided me, ever sin’ I met
her on the deck,” grumbled the Scotchman. “Will ye
hear a mon speak for himsel’ before you accuse him,
lass?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And sure what can ye say for yourself at all at all,
afther being found upon the <em>Sea Scourge</em> among a lot iv
divels?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Young leddy,” said the Scotchman, appealing to Miss
Conyers, “will you condescend to speak to the lass and bid
her be reasonable?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, McAlpine, I am so pained to hear that you
were one of the crew of the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, that I have
nothing to say against Judith’s natural indignation,” said
Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“Ou, ay! a mon gets it on baith sides! May be, young
leddy, ye’ll let me expleen before you judge me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you can explain to Judith’s satisfaction, I should
like to hear you do it, McAlpine,” said Miss Conyers,
gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aweel then, after our boat was picked up by the
Dutchman, I took service with the captain and went the
voyage to Calcutta, and then back to England. After
whilk I shipped on a merchantman in St. Catherine’s
docks, calling hersel’ the <em>Sea Scourge</em>, bound for the Indies,
and sailing under the Stars and Stripes. And here
I will take leave to say that being a native of Ayrshire
in Scotland, I owe nae mair allegiance to the Stars and
Stripes than I do to the Stars and Garters or to the Stars
and Crescent—whilk last I take to be the emblem of the
Turk; or to the Stars and Bars, whatever they may represent,
or to the stars in conjunction with ony ither
creature. It was na, however, until we overhauled a Baltimore
clipper that the <em>Sea Scourge</em> ran up the Stars and
Bars, and I kenned for the first time that I was shipped
on board a preevateer. I had nae choice but to bide where
I was, whilk I did until the engagement wi’ the <em>Xyphias</em>,
when the preevateer was captured.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And ye fought ag’inst us, ye murthering divil,” put
in Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, lass, that was na my duty; I was on the foretop,
and na at the guns. I helped to work the ship, that was
a’; and e’en that’ wi’ nae guid will; for I aye argued wi’
mysel’ that I had been entrapped intil the service of the
preevateer; but I could na help mysel’ till the fight was
over. I was wounded, as ye see, by a bit splinter that
struck my head, and I fell to the deck, breaking my arm
and spraining my ankle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom, is it the truth ye’re afther telling me?” inquired
Judith, through her tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, lass; what else? D’ye think I would tell ye a
lee?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thin, Tom, darlint, I beg your pardon entirely for
thinking ill iv ye. Troth——” And here Judith broke
down and sobbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hout, tout, lass! dree your een and sae nae mair,”
said Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“Tom, ye’re a jewel, sure; but how came ye here at all
at all, whin all the prisoners were left at Cape Town except
thim that took the oath of illaygiance and shipped
on the <em>Xyphias</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tould my tale to the captain, and said I would like to
take service on the prize. And when I was able to leave
my hammock he granted my petition and put me here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Och, Tom, jewel, sure my hearts broke entirely wid
the thought iv how I misthrusted and abused ye,” said
Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hout, lass, sae nae mair. D’ye think a bit hard word
is gaun to part you and me after a’ that’s come and
gane?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers had been for some time dropped out of
the conversation. And now honest Tom became so extremely
sentimental that she really felt herself one too
many; and so she arose, and leaving the sweethearts together,
she slipped away to her seat in the stern.</p>

<p class='c007'>There presently her own ill-used lover joined her. And
she gave him the solution of the ghost riddle by describing
her meeting with Foretop Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is singular that I have never chanced to meet him,”
said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fancy that he has been below in his hammock until
lately. He looks scarcely fit for duty now,” said Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then as the night was growing damp and chilly,
and the lights in the cabin looked cheerful and inviting,
Miss Conyers proposed to her companion to go below;
and they went and finished their evening in music and
conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day Justin had an interview with Foretop
Tom, who was able to tell him much more relating to the
rescue of the missionary party than he had learned from
the Burneys.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom related all that he knew, either from observation
or hearsay—how that the crew of the lifeboat, finding
all their arguments and persuasions vain to induce their
captain to desert the ship and join them, and being moved
by the tears and prayers of the missionaries’ wives, had
at last consented to receive the two missionaries, who,
being of slight form, they said, would not both together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>take up much more room than that left vacant by the
stout captain. So they had been rescued from the wreck
of the <em>Sultana</em>, picked up by the Dutch merchantman,
and afterward taken on board by the East Indiaman,
which was luckily bound to the very port of Calcutta for
which they themselves had sailed in the ill-fated <em>Sultana</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this time no event occurred to vary the monotony
of the sea voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they drew nearer to the shores of their native country,
Justin and Britomarte began to experience an intense
and ever deepening anxiety. How, after so long an
absence, should they find the friends they had left at
home? Were they well? Were they even living? Who
could tell? How slow was their approach to their destination!
how torturing their suspense!</p>

<p class='c007'>There came a day when Lieutenant Ethel said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“In three weeks, if we have good luck, we shall make
New York harbor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then they counted the weeks, until the morning
came when the young commander said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If this weather holds we shall be in port in four days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then they counted the days until the night arrived
in which the lieutenant announced:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall be in New York at dawn to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then they counted the hours. They sat up on deck
until a late hour, hoping to be able to make out their native
shore before going to rest. But there was no moon;
and though the sky was clear and the stars bright overhead,
yet the western horizon, on which their line of
coast should appear, was veiled with clouds and fogs.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length, weary with watching, they bade each other
good-night and retired to their respective staterooms.
Yet even then and there they could not sleep. The keen
anxiety as to how they should find their friends, if indeed
they should find them at all, and how they should find
their country, if civil war had left them a country undivided—chased
slumber from their eyes, until near dawn,
when, as often happens to night-watchers, they fell asleep
from sheer exhaustion, and slept profoundly until a late
hour of the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte was then aroused by a loud rapping at her
stateroom door.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>She started up, only half awake and much bewildered,
and demanded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sister, it is I. I have come to tell you that we are
anchored in New York harbor,” answered the voice of
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>With an irrepressible cry of joy Britomarte sprang up,
and with hands trembling with delight, began to dress
herself. She was as much overjoyed by the announcement
as though she had not been confidently expecting it.
She was soon dressed and out on deck, where Justin advanced
to meet her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And all the land is rejoicing in the news of the glorious
victory just gained!” he said as he led her on where
she could see the forest of shipping in the harbor, and
the forest of spires in the great city beyond.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank Heaven! Thank Heaven!” she fervently exclaimed,
with a heart too full to utter another word.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tide of war has turned, my sister. And the whole
city is rejoicing in the news of a glorious victory,” repeated
Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You told me that before. Yes, I heard you, and I
thank Heaven for that also. This victory, Justin! Is it
a final one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dare not say that. But the precursor of a final one,
we may venture to predict.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And where was it gained?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At Gettysburg.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At Gettysburg! Why, that is in Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my sister. Lee has invaded Pennsylvania; but
has been met at Gettysburg by the Union army under
General Meade, and driven back with tremendous loss.
The news of the victory has just reached New York, and
the city is mad with joy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is glorious news to greet us on our arrival!” said
Lieutenant Ethel, coming up. “Good-morning, Miss
Conyers. Let us congratulate each other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With all my heart!” exclaimed Britomarte, cordially
grasping the hand that was extended to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here are the morning papers, Rosenthal. A boat has
just come alongside and brought them,” continued the
young lieutenant showing a half-dozen of the journals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>of the day, which he immediately divided between Justin,
Britomarte and himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>But all three were really too much excited to compose
themselves to reading. They did but devour the telegraphic
news containing the brief announcement of the
victory of Gettysburg, and then they began to talk about
it, and they continued to talk until the steward came to
say that breakfast was on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went into the cabin and sat down to the table.
But who could eat? They drank some coffee and made a
pretense of nibbling some bread and meat. But even the
fresh eggs and beefsteak, rare luxuries to the voyagers,
that the boat had brought alongside that morning in time
for their breakfast, could not tempt them.</p>

<p class='c007'>They soon arose and made preparations to go on shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal part of Justin’s, Britomarte’s and Judith’s
effects had been packed up for several days. All
that they had to do now was to put up the few articles
that they had left out for immediate use.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this was done they put on their outer garments
and were ready to leave the ship—only waiting for Lieutenant
Ethel, who had a few last orders to give before
accompanying them on shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin and Britomarte sat in the stern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My sister,” said the young man, “let me be a brother
to you in reality. We are about to leave the ship which
has been our home so long. The greater part of our effects
has perished in the using, and the greater part of our
means is lost. Tell me now, as you would tell your
brother, what are your plans for the future, Britomarte?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will,” she answered, frankly. “Certainly my wardrobe
is rather dilapidated, and nearly three years behind
the time; but still, as it is clean and whole, I hope it will
be considered decent and passable. For the rest I have
about thirty dollars in gold, which you saved with my
other effects from the wreck. This will suffice to take me
to Washington, and keep me for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As Heaven wills.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin groaned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Britomarte, my beloved! that you would give me
a legal right to protect you!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“Justin! no more of that I implore you, if we are to
retain even the semblance of friendship,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is but a semblance on your part, at least, I sometimes
think,” said Justin, bitterly; then quickly repenting
the injustice of his words, he added—“But no! you saved
my life at the most imminent hazard of your own. Yes,
your friendship, Britomarte, passes the love of other
women. Yet, oh, my soul! why is it, why, that you abjure
the only relation in which we can rationally stand
to each other? Well, well—I will not ask you. I will
try to be silent on that subject—silent forever! I——”
his voice quite broke down and he covered his working
features with his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>She looked at him and turned pale with the excess of
her own emotions. She laid her hand tenderly upon his,
and faltered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin! brother! dearest brother! I am not worth all
this feeling! indeed, indeed I am not, Justin. I would
die to give you content—Heaven knows that I would. I
would die, but I cannot marry you, Justin! I cannot!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall never again ask you to do so,” he mournfully
replied: “I shall—as soon as I see you safe to Washington,
and meet my father and my sister—I shall enlist in
the army, and in discharging the high duty that I owe
my country I shall seek to forget my private griefs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, do so, Justin! do so, dearest brother! and my
prayers will follow you, and the favor of Heaven shall be
upon you! And if you are not happy, you will still be
blessed, since all who do their duty are so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it is not of myself that I think; it is of you—of
you! So young, so beautiful, and—forgive me, Britomarte—so
poor and friendless! When I think of that,
and of your obstinacy, all my strength and manhood
desert me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense, Justin; I have health, intellect, freedom
and—thirty dollars in gold to start with. Now, what
would you think of a young man in my place with all
these advantages? Would you make such a moan over
him? Not a bit of it. You would think his prospects
exceedingly promising. Now I assure you, Mr. Rosenthal,
that—all other things being equal—a young woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>is quite as well able to take care of herself as a young
man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this war! this war!” groaned Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Exactly. This war will open to me, as to others, a
field of duty and usefulness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While they spoke Judith and Tom had been standing
at a short distance away, conversing together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the girl approached Miss Conyers, and stood rolling
the strings of her bonnet and blushing deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, Judith?” the young lady asked, kindly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, ma’am, ye know I towld yez that when we
landed I should go to me aunt, who keeps a ship chandler’s
shop on Wather street, and she’d give me a home
or get me a service?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Judith; are you not going there?—have you
changed your mind?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, ma’am, sure; but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what, Judith? Out with it,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me gay Tom wants me to marry him,” said the girl,
turning as red as a cabbage rose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Judith?” said Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, ma’am, sure you rimimber I promised you nivir
to marry any man till the laws was changed so the women
could get the upper hand iv the men entirely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not exactly so, Judith; but you promised me never to
marry until the cruel laws are changed so that we women
may have our rights,” amended Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, ma’am, and sure ain’t that all the same?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not precisely. But what is it you wish to do now,
Judith? Do you wish me to protect you against the importunities
of your lover? I will do so effectually.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you wish me to speak to Lieutenant Ethel to order
Tom McAlpine to let you alone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Och, no, sure, not for the world, ma’am!” exclaimed
Judith, in dismay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you want, then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, ma’am, I want ye to relaise me from me promise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought so,” laughed Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To release you from your promise, Judith?” questioned
Britomarte, with a mortified air.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“Yes, ma’am, plaise,” said Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better do it at once, sister, or she will break
through it,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you wish to be released from a promise so
freely and deliberately given, Judith?” gravely inquired
Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you see, ma’am,” answered Judith, blushing and
looking down and twirling her bonnet strings, “whin I
made that same promise nivir to marry a man till the laws
was changed, sure I was on that baste iv an island, where
there was nivir a man to marry at all at all—let alone
belaiving me gay Tom was dhrowned. So you see it
made no differ. But now I’m back in a Christian counthry,
and me gay Tom alive and well, and now sure I
want to be relaised from me promise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Judith, I release you from your promise; but I
do it only because I feel sure that if I did not you would
break it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, ma’am, I thank you kindly, so I do; and so will
me gay Tom,” said Judith, much relieved, as she turned
and walked to rejoin her lover, who stood waiting for her
in evident anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never could understand why Judith should call that
grave and stolid Scotchman her ‘gay’ Tom,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She did it first in covert sarcasm, no doubt. And
she has since continued it from habit,” answered Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel now joined them, saying that the
boat was ready to take them ashore.</p>

<p class='c007'>They immediately arose and went to the starboard
side of the ship and descended to the boat, followed by
the lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they had all taken their places the boat was
pushed off. A few rapid strokes of the oar brought
them to the pier, where they got off, hailing with deep
and heartfelt gratitude their native land.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLI.<br> <span class='c005'>NATIVE LAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Now,” said Lieutenant Ethel, on taking a temporary
leave of them, “I have some official business with
the authorities here which must be attended to at once;
so I shall have to leave you for a while; but I will send
a man with you, and when you have found, and are settled
in your hotel for the present, you can send him
back to the ship with your address, and I will forward
all your luggage without further trouble to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You pursue us with benefits,” said Justin, cordially
pressing his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if I succeed in seeing the parties I wish to see,
and getting my business through in time, I will join
you and spend the evening with you. By the way,
when do you go on to Washington?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the first train to-morrow. I should go on to-night,
but it is absolutely necessary that I should write
to a friend there to prepare my sister for my arrival.
You know that she must long have looked upon me as
lost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Then, if you go on to-morrow, I think that I
shall be able to accompany you. You are aware that I
am the bearer of dispatches to the Secretary of the
Navy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well! Good-morning! I hope you will find pleasant
quarters. Martin, do you go with Mr. Rosenthal’s
party,” said the young lieutenant. And then, raising
his cap to Miss Conyers, he struck into a by-street and
was soon out of sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sailor left in attendance upon Mr. Rosenthal
stood hat in hand, waiting orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Martin,” said Justin, “go and call a carriage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man started on the errand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers turned to Judith, who was standing
with Tom McAlpine by her side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Judith,” said the young lady, “will you go with me
to the hotel for the present?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“No, thank you kindly, ma’am. When the carriage
comes, and I see ye into it, sure Tom will take me to
my aunt’s. And whin I’ve seen her, I can go back to
the ship and find out from Mr. Martin where yez are
stopping. And I will come up this evening to take
leave iv yez.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, Judith,” said Miss Conyers, with the
tears starting in her eyes, for the companionship of
more than two years had very much attached her to
the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few moments the sailor returned with the carriage,
and Justin put Britomarte into it, followed her,
and gave the driver an order to drive to a certain hotel,
where he had once been in the habit of stopping.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a quiet, respectable house, in a comparatively
still neighborhood, and it happened to have some
pleasant rooms vacant and at the disposal of our party.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as Justin had seen Britomarte comfortably
ensconced in her apartment, he went down and dispatched
the sailor back to the ship with his address for
Lieutenant Ethel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Justin started out on foot to visit his uncle,
Friedrich Rosenthal, the great importer, at his place
of business in Chambers street. Besides his earnest
desire to see a kinsman whom he sincerely loved and
esteemed, he felt a great anxiety to hear such news of
his father and sister as Mr. Friedrich Rosenthal would
probably be able to give him, and also he needed funds
to defray his hotel bill and his expenses to Washington,
and which his wealthy uncle would readily advance
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin walked rapidly down the street, sharply turning
the corners at the imminent risk of upsetting old
ladies and running over little children, until he turned
into Chambers street, where every step that brought
him nearer to his uncle’s house, and to certain news of
his beloved relatives, increased his anxiety and took
away his breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>He came in sight of the house and looked up. A
strange name occupied the signboard:</p>

<p class='c007'>Steinfeldt.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a sudden pause in all his pulses, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>he hurried into the house, and glanced up and down
the long lines of bales upon bales of goods, and upon
the strange array of faces behind them.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the strangers advanced to meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What would you look at, sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is—has Mr. Friedrich Rosenthal retired from business?”
faltered Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Friedrich Rosenthal? I am not able to say,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long have you been here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nearly a year, sir,” replied the young man, looking
surprised at the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the—is Mr. Steinfeldt in?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; in the countingroom, back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin had no cards, but he took a scrap of paper
from a writing-table near, and wrote his name, and
handed it to the young man, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you take this to Mr. Steinfeldt?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The youth started off on the errand, and presently
returned, accompanied by a stout, respectable-looking,
middle-aged man, whose rubicund countenance expressed
much concern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a relative of the late Mr. Rosenthal, I presume?”
said this gentleman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The late!” echoed Justin, starting back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! I am very sorry, exceedingly sorry, to have
spoken so thoughtlessly. But, bless my soul, I supposed—— And
it has been so long—over a year!”
stammered Mr. Steinfeldt, with a face full of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been absent from the country for more than
two years. I have just returned from India,” said Justin,
not wishing then and there to enter upon the particulars
of his shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bless my soul, yes! And yet knew nothing of
what had happened here. Letters, perhaps, miscarried,
or passed you. Dear me! yes, it must be a great shock.
Come into my countingroom and recover yourself.
Here, Perkins! wine—quick!” said Steinfeldt, leading
the way to the back of the warerooms, followed by Justin,
who accepted his invitation only that he might learn
the particulars of his uncle’s death, and if possible, also,
some news of his father and sister.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>The kind-hearted merchant made him sit down in an
easy-chair, and, when the wine came, pressed upon
him a glass of good old port.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is a great shock. You say that it is more
than a year since my uncle died.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has been—about fourteen months.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was the cause of his death?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An attack of pneumonia, that carried him off after
about ten days’ illness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were any of his family with him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had no family of his own, as you probably know.
He had one brother in Germany, but of course there
was no time to summon him. His orphan niece, a
young lady from Washington, was with him when he
died.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he had a brother in Washington—a Lutheran
minister,” said Justin, feeling his heart stand still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, yes—the father of that niece who was with
him in his last moments. But he went before. He fell
in the first battle of Bull’s Run.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh-h-h!” groaned Justin, dropping his head upon
the table with such a moan of unspeakable agony that
the good merchant sprang to his feet and leaned over
him, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lord forgive me! And you—you are his son, and
I have blurted this dreadful news so suddenly. I was
thinking that you were the son of the brother in Germany.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin did not answer. His shoulders rose and fell
with the great sobs that shook his frame.</p>

<p class='c007'>The merchant went and closed the door of the room,
and drew the bolt, so that no other eyes should look upon
the anguish of his fellow-man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My sister; where is she?” at length asked Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She returned to Washington, enriched by the will
of her uncle, who constituted her the sole heiress of
his immense wealth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enriched in fortune, but, oh, how impoverished in
home!” groaned Justin. Then rising, he held out his
hand to the merchant, saying, “I thank you, sir, for the
information you have given, as well as for your delicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>kindness to a heavily-stricken man; and I will bid
you good-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you a carriage at the door?” inquired the practical
merchant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I must order one for you. You are not in a
condition to walk through the streets, Mr. Rosenthal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin bowed his thanks and resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>And when the carriage was announced, he took leave
of the friendly merchant and drove to his hotel. He
went at once to his own room, and gave way to the sorrow
that was almost bursting his bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some hours later, when he had attained some degree
of calmness, he entered the sitting-room, occupied in common
by himself and Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Conyers was deeply engaged reading an “extra,”
with further details of the great battle of Gettysburg.
On hearing the door open, she looked up, and was at once
shocked by seeing Justin enter, looking pale as death,
and wearing the traces of deep grief upon his brow.</p>

<p class='c007'>She threw down the paper and started up to meet him,
exclaiming, breathlessly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Justin, what is the matter? What have you heard?
Erminie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He crossed the room and threw himself upon the sofa.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erminie!” again gasped Miss Conyers, in breathless
anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte, Erminie is alive and well, but—fatherless!”
he groaned, covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Justin! Oh, Justin! Oh, my dear, dear brother!”
she cried, and forgetting all her pride, she hastened to
his side, put her arms around his neck, drew his head
upon her bosom, and bending her face upon it, wept with
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>And her sympathy was an unspeakable consolation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later in the day Justin nerved himself to write a letter
to his sister, and this letter he inclosed in another
one directed to a clerical friend in Washington, to whom
he announced his return, and whom he solicited to go
and break the news cautiously to Erminie, and prepare
her for his arrival. Having posted this letter with his
own hand, to insure its going by the evening mail, he returned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>and dined alone with Britomarte in their sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel, true to his engagement, came to
spend the evening with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He entered at first, full of a project to take the whole
party to the Academy of Music, to see a new opera that
was creating a great sensation. But as soon as he saw
the faces of Justin and Britomarte, he knew that some
distressing intelligence had met them on their arrival, and
he forbore to mention his plan. He greeted them both
gravely, and then took the chair offered him by Justin,
and looked from one to the other in mute, respectful sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have received ill news since I saw you last. I have
to mourn the death of my father,” said Justin, in a low
voice, while Britomarte turned away her face to conceal
“the teardrops that from pity fell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very much grieved,” said the young lieutenant,
simply and earnestly. “Is there anything that I can do
for you? If there is, pray order me. It will be a satisfaction
to me to be of service to you in any way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, thanks,” murmured Justin, earnestly pressing
the hand that he had extended to him; “I do not
know that you can do anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now tell me frankly—I came with the intention
of spending the whole evening with yourself and Miss
Conyers, either here or somewhere else, no matter where—but
now tell me candidly, would you rather I should remain
here, or go away? Speak freely. If you wish me
to remain, I will do so with comfort, or if you wish me to
go, I shall not take offense,” said young Ethel, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not wish you to go, good friend, for your presence
will be a comfort to us; neither dare I press you to
stay, for the evening will be as dull to you as it is sad to
us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For all answer Lieutenant Ethel took off his gloves and
put them in his pocket, and drew his chair nearer to that
of Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Britomarte arose and rung for tea to be brought up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you tell me more? How did your honored father
die? That he died the death of the righteous I know, as
a matter of course; but was he ill long?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“He was not ill. He was in the army; he fell at the
first battle of Bull Run,” answered Justin, gravely, adding:
“That is all I know as yet. I learned that much
only from the man who has succeeded to my uncle’s business.
My good uncle, too, has passed away; but that
lesser grief is swallowed up in the greater one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! yes, yes,” sighed the young lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few minutes passed in silence, during which a waiter
appeared with the tea service. When he had arranged
the table, Miss Conyers dismissed him, and presided herself
over the tea-urn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you succeeded in completing your business to-day,”
said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, thank Heaven, that I did, especially as I am now
doubly anxious to bear you company on to Washington,”
replied the young man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a good fellow, Ethel,” said Justin, gravely.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it was decided that they should leave for Washington
by the first train in the morning, it was thought advisable
that they should all retire to rest at an early hour
that night; so Lieutenant Ethel, at nine o’clock, arose to
take his leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall go on board again to-night, so as to give my
last instructions to Passed Midshipman Allen, whom I
shall leave in charge of the prize. But I shall be sure to
meet you at the train to-morrow,” he said, as he shook
hands with Justin and Britomarte, and bowed himself
out of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few moments longer the two friends remained in
conversation, and then Britomarte bade Justin good-night
and withdrew to her chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>There she found Judith waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! is it you, my dear girl? I am glad to see you.
I was afraid that something had prevented you from coming,
and that I should not see you again before leaving,”
said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Troth, sooner than that should have happened, I would
have gone to the gates iv the station, so I would, and
watched every living soul that came in and every train
that wint out till I saw you. But sure I got the name iv
the house from Martin, and troth I made me gay Tom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>fetch me here! and here I’ve been staying, waiting for
you, these three hours,” said Judith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry. I didn’t know that you were here, or I
shouldn’t have kept you waiting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bother the odds, asking your pardon, ma’am, for I
was very comfortable entirely. But now it’s only to say
good-by and good luck to you, ma’am; for it’s getting on
to ten o’clock, and I must be going, for me aunt can’t
abide late hours, so she can’t,” said Judith, rising to go.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You found your aunt well?” kindly inquired Miss
Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Divil a bit betther at any time iv her life; only whin
she saw me, as she thought me dhrowned many a long
day ago, she wint off into the highstrikes, so she did, and
had fits so fast that we had to give her four glasses iv
rum before she would come round. But sure she’s all
right now, ma’am, except in the matter iv a pain in her
temper, as she is subject to; and be the same token, I
mustn’t bring it onto her by staying out late, so I will bid
you good-by, and God bless you, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by! and may the Lord bless you also, Judith,”
said Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But sure I’d like to take lave iv Misther Rosenthal
before I go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will find him in his sitting-room, Judith. Any of
the waiters will show you where that is,” said Miss
Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>And she drew the girl to her bosom and kissed her before
she let her depart.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XLII.<br> <span class='c005'>HOME AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After a very early breakfast, Justin and Britomarte,
with all their luggage, set out by the first omnibus that
left the hotel for the early train to Washington. After
paying his hotel bill, Justin had scarcely five dollars left,
but he knew that he could get an advance from Lieutenant
Ethel, whom he could reimburse immediately upon his
arrival at Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>They met the young lieutenant on the ferryboat. He
advanced smilingly toward them, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see that I am punctual, and more than punctual,
for I meet you on the ferryboat, instead of at the station.
We could not have had a finer day for our journey,” he
added, cheerfully, as he shook hands with Justin and with
Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>For you see, Lieutenant Ethel was not one of those
mistaken individuals who imagine that they must always
continue to wear a long face on a bereaved friend. He
had earnestly expressed his sympathy and heartily offered
his services; and his action stood good for all times; and
now he meant to be cheerful, and to try to cheer them.</p>

<p class='c007'>They reached the station in good time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving Miss Conyers in the ladies’ room, they went
together to the office to procure their tickets; and there
Justin told the lieutenant of his dilemma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Draw on me, my dear fellow, for any amount in my
possession. I have a hundred dollars in my pocketbook,
and you are welcome to ninety of them,” said the young
man, cordially.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which would leave you just money enough to take you
to Washington. No, thank you. Twenty dollars will
answer my purpose, if you will let me have the use of
that sum until I get home,” smiled Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish it was twenty thousand, instead of twenty dollars,
and that I were as able to give you the big sum as I
am willing to lend you the little one,” said the lieutenant,
placing a note in Justin’s hand. Justin thanked him, and
got the tickets for himself and for Britomarte.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving the hotel, Miss Conyers had placed her
pocketbook, containing thirty dollars, in the hands of
Justin, with the request that he would keep it to pay her
traveling expenses until they should reach their journey’s
end, when he might return it. And Justin, to prevent, or
rather to defer a dispute on the subject, had accepted the
trust; but neither for her hotel bill nor for her railroad
ticket had he touched her little hoard. He was resolved
to return the pocketbook intact as he had received it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having secured their tickets and checked their baggage,
they rejoined Britomarte and took her to the train,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>and found comfortable seats in the ladies’ car, to which
Britomarte’s companionship admitted them both.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were scarcely seated, when the newsboys came
into the car, crying the morning papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<cite>Times</cite>, <cite>Herald</cite>, <cite>World</cite>, <cite>Tribune</cite>, <em>et cetera</em>. Full particulars
of the Battle of Gettysburg!—Capture of the
Pirate <em>Sea Scourge</em>!—Wonderful rescue of three shipwrecked
passengers from a Desert Island!—<cite>Tribune</cite>,
<cite>World</cite>, <cite>Herald</cite>, <cite>Times</cite>!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, who on earth could have put our adventure in!”
exclaimed Justin, half amused and half annoyed at the
circumstance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Ethel blushed and then laughed, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid I am responsible for that! though I never
supposed it would get into the papers. You see, yesterday
I told the whole story of the cruise of the <em>Xyphias</em> to
some friends and strangers that I met at dinner at the
Astor House. I dare say there were some gentlemen of
the press present, though I did not think so at the time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That accounts for all, then,” said Justin.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the party bought half a dozen papers. And the
train started.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had a swift and pleasant run to Washington,
where they arrived safely at seven o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>On reaching the station, Lieutenant Ethel left the car
first, to go and secure a carriage for his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Britomarte! my dear, dear Britomarte, you will come
home with me to Erminie? Don’t wound me by refusing!
Say that you will come,” urged Justin, when he was
left alone with Miss Conyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no, no! not this evening, for the world! For this
evening you and your sister should meet alone,” she earnestly
replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-morrow, then?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes! to-morrow I will see Erminie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As every one was now leaving the cars, they arose from
their seats and went out. Lieutenant Ethel met them
with a carriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where, then, shall we take you to-night?” questioned
Justin, as he handed Britomarte into her place.</p>

<p class='c007'>She named the hotel where she wished to stop. And
Justin gave the order to drive there.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>On arriving at the house, he took care to secure a good
room for Miss Conyers; but not until he was on the
point of taking leave of her did he hand her her pocketbook.
And he was relieved to see that, without examination,
she put it in her pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he bade her good-night, and re-entered the carriage
and drove to the house of that clerical friend to
whom he had written to prepare Erminie for his arrival.
He did not leave his carriage, lest his friend should detain
him too long from his sister. He merely sent in a
request that the Rev. Mr. Sales would come out and speak
to him for a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>And when that gentleman came out, full of wonder and
welcome and warm congratulations, Justin eagerly inquired
if he had received his letter and delivered the inclosure
to its destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>And being answered in the affirmative, and informed
that his sister was prepared to receive him, Justin cordially
thanked Mr. Sales for his kind offices.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clergyman would willingly have detained Mr.
Rosenthal, and made a lion of him for the evening. But
Justin excused himself upon the ground of his great impatience
to meet his sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so Mr. Sales, with many expressions of amazement
and thankfulness that Justin and his companions should
have been so providentially preserved and happily restored
to their friends, suffered him to depart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Justin gave the order to drive to the parsonage, and
then threw himself back on his cushions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ah! who can imagine the emotions with which, after
so long an absence, he drew near his father’s house?</p>

<p class='c007'>As in a dream, he saw the lights of the shops whirl
past each side, as his carriage rolled through the streets.
In a dream he perceived that it stopped before the gate
of his old home. In a dream, he found himself going up
the shaded walk, standing under the vine-wreathed portico,
ringing the bell, and entering the door. Still in a
dream, he found himself in a lighted drawing-room, and
saw before him his sister Erminie, dressed as he had never
seen her in his waking hours—in the deepest mourning.
With a great cry:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“My brother! Oh, my brother!” she ran to him and
threw herself upon his bosom.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then he awoke! He clasped her closely to his
heart. And they wept in each other’s arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erminie was the first to recover herself. She lifted her
head from his bosom and murmured the question:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know, my brother, you know that—that——”
her voice again broke down into sobs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know all, sweet sister, all!” he answered, tenderly
caressing her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He died—as he wished to die—cheering on his men to
the charge!—to that gallant charge which, for the time
being, turned the tide of battle and almost redeemed the
day, even on that fatal field of Manassas!” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He died a hero’s death; he fills a hero’s grave; he
leaves to all posterity a hero’s name!” murmured Justin,
lovingly soothing her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On, Justin, I think, had there been many leaders like
him in our army that day, the defeat had been a victory.”</p>

<hr class='c011'>

<p class='c007'>With the departure of the shipwrecked lovers from the
deserted island, that had been their refuge for so long a
time, closed the most singular phase in their lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>With their arrival in their native country to find it in
the horrors of civil war, commences for them a career
of activity and adventures full</p>
